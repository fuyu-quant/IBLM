Please create your code in compliance with all of the following conditions. Output should be code only.
・What is the Python code to predict the value of "target" based on the following data?
------------------
columns_name
{{columns_name}}
dataset
{{dataset_str}}
------------------
・Output the logic to calculate the value of "target" from given data relationships without using existing machine learning methods as python code.
・Please make your predictions as accurate as possible.
・You do not need to provide examples.
・You need to enclose the output in "#########".
・Create a code like the following.
#########
def predict(x):
    import numpy as np

    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.


        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
#########
