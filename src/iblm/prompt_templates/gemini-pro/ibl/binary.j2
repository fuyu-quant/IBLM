Please create your code in compliance with all of the following conditions. Output should be code only.
・The following data are labeled 0 or 1. Please output Python code to predict the probability that the label is 1 for the unknown data.
------------------
columns_name
{{columns_name}}
dataset
{{dataset_str}}
------------------
・Think and code the logic to predict probability values based on the data without using a existing machine learning model.
・Please make your predictions as accurate as possible.
・Predicting probability values as finely as possible increases overall accuracy.
・You do not need to provide examples.
・You need to enclose the output in "#########".
・Create a code like the following.
#########
def predict(x):
    import numpy as np

    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.


        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
#########
