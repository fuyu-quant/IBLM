Please create your code in compliance with all of the following conditions. Output should be code only. Do not enclose the output in ``python ``` or the like.
・Analyze the large amount of data below and create a {{task_type}} code to accurately predict "target".
------------------
{{dataset_str}}
------------------
・Each data type is as follows. If necessary, you can change the data type.
・Create code that can make predictions about new data based on logic from large amounts of input data without using machine learning models.
・If input is available, the column names below should also be used to help make decisions when creating the predictive model. Column Name:{{col_name}}
・Create a code like the following. Do not change the input or output format.
・If {{col_option}} is not blank, add it after 'df = x.copy()'.
・You do not need to provide examples.
------------------
def predict(x):
    import numpy as np

    df = x.copy()

    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():


        # Feature creation and data preprocessing


        {{output_code}}
        output.append(y)

    output = np.array(output)

    return output
