Please create your code in compliance with all of the following conditions. 
・Analyze the data given below and write python code to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1.
・Never use machine learning algorithms.
・Only Python functions should be output.
・Please come up with a logic that allows you to predict probability values as closely as possible.
・For the data given below, create a code that predicts a high probability value when "target" is likely to be 1 and a low probability value when "target" is unlikely to be 1.
・The 'target' value cannot be used for forecasting.
・Analyze the data in as much detail as possible.
・Each data type is {data_type_}.
・The column names, in order, are as follows {col_name_}.
・Create a code like the following.
------------
import numpy as np
def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    {col_option_}
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.

        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
