Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the weights for the logistic regression model
        weights = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4])
        
        # Calculate the weighted sum of inputs
        weighted_sum = np.dot(row[:-1], weights)
        
        # Apply the sigmoid function to the weighted sum
        y = sigmoid(weighted_sum)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

Please note that the weights in the logistic regression model are set to arbitrary values (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, these weights would be learned from the data using a learning algorithm.
