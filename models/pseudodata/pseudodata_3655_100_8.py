Here is a simple Python code that uses a linear regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code assumes that the input 'x' is a pandas DataFrame with columns 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'target'.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    model = LogisticRegression()
    model.fit(df[['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']], df['target'])
    probabilities = model.predict_proba(df[['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']])
    return probabilities[:, 1]
```

This code first trains a logistic regression model on the input data. Then, it uses this model to predict the probability of the target being 1 for each row in the input data. The output is a numpy array of these probabilities.

Please note that this code uses the LogisticRegression class from the sklearn.linear_model module, which is a commonly used machine learning library in Python. This class implements logistic regression, a simple and widely used statistical model for binary classification problems.
