Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Calculate the weighted sum of inputs
        weighted_sum = row['a'] * 0.1 + row['b'] * 0.2 + row['c'] * 0.3 + row['d'] * 0.4

        # Output the prediction using the sigmoid activation function
        y = sigmoid(weighted_sum)

        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a helper function `sigmoid(x)` that implements the sigmoid activation function, which is used in logistic regression to output a probability that the given input point belongs to a certain class (in this case, "target" = 1).

The `predict(x)` function then applies this logistic regression model to each row of the input DataFrame `x`. For each row, it calculates a weighted sum of the input features 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd', using some arbitrary weights (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 in this case). It then applies the sigmoid function to this weighted sum to output a probability value, which is appended to the `output` list.

Finally, the function returns the `output` list as a numpy array.

Please note that this is a very basic implementation and the weights used in the weighted sum calculation are arbitrary. In a real-world scenario, you would want to train your logistic regression model on your data to learn the optimal weights that minimize the prediction error.
