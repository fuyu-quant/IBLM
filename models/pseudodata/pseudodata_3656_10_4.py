Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        z = 0.1*row['a'] + 0.2*row['b'] + 0.3*row['c'] + 0.4*row['d']
        y = sigmoid(z)
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

In this code, the `sigmoid` function is used to map any real-valued number into another number between 0 and 1. In machine learning, we use sigmoid to map predictions to probabilities.

The `predict` function applies a linear transformation to the input data (the coefficients 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 are arbitrary and should be learned from data in a real-world scenario) and then applies the sigmoid function to map the result to a probability.

Please note that this is a very basic and naive implementation of logistic regression. In a real-world scenario, you would use a machine learning library like scikit-learn to train a logistic regression model on your data, which would learn the best coefficients to use in the linear transformation.
