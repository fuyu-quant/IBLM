Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.1 * row['a'] + 0.2 * row['b'] + 0.3 * row['c'] + 0.4 * row['d']
        
        # Apply the sigmoid function to get the probability
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a sigmoid function, which is used to map any real-valued number into the range between 0 and 1. This function is used in the logistic regression model to output probabilities.

In the `predict` function, we iterate over each row in the input DataFrame. For each row, we calculate a linear combination of the features 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd', using some arbitrary weights (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 in this case). This linear combination is then passed through the sigmoid function to get a probability, which is appended to the output list.

Please note that this is a very basic implementation and the weights used in the logistic regression model are arbitrary. In a real-world scenario, these weights would be learned from the data using a learning algorithm.
