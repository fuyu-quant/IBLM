Here is a simple Python code that uses a linear regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code assumes that the input `x` is a pandas DataFrame with the same structure as the data provided.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []

    # Separate the features and the target
    features = df[['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']]
    target = df['target']

    # Train a linear regression model
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(features, target)

    # Predict the probabilities
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        y = model.predict([row[['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']]])
        # Since linear regression can predict values outside the range [0, 1], we clip the values
        y = np.clip(y, 0, 1)
        output.append(y)

    return np.array(output)
```

This code first separates the features and the target from the input DataFrame. Then, it trains a linear regression model using these data. After that, it uses the trained model to predict the probability of the target being 1 for each row in the DataFrame. The predicted probabilities are clipped to the range [0, 1] because the linear regression model can predict values outside this range. Finally, the function returns the predicted probabilities as a numpy array.
