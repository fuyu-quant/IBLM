Here is a simple Python code that uses a linear regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code assumes that the input 'x' is a pandas DataFrame with columns 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'target'.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    model = LogisticRegression()
    model.fit(df[['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']], df['target'])
    output = model.predict_proba(df[['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']])[:,1]
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first trains a logistic regression model on the input data. Then it uses the trained model to predict the probability of the target being 1 for each row in the input data. The predicted probabilities are returned as a numpy array.

Please note that this code uses the LogisticRegression class from the sklearn.linear_model module, which is a commonly used machine learning library in Python. The LogisticRegression class implements logistic regression which is a type of regression analysis used for predicting the probability of a binary outcome.
