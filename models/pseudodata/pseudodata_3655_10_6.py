Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    weights = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4])  # Initialize weights
    bias = -0.5  # Initialize bias

    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Compute the weighted sum of inputs
        weighted_sum = np.dot(row[:-1], weights) + bias

        # Apply the sigmoid activation function
        y = sigmoid(weighted_sum)

        output.append(y)

    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a helper function `sigmoid(x)` that implements the sigmoid activation function, which is used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1]. This function is then used in the `predict(x)` function to compute the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1.

In the `predict(x)` function, we first copy the input DataFrame `x` to a new DataFrame `df` to avoid modifying the original data. We then initialize the weights and bias of the logistic regression model. These parameters can be adjusted to improve the accuracy of the model.

Next, we iterate over each row in the DataFrame. For each row, we compute the weighted sum of the input features (excluding the "target" column) and the weights of the model, and add the bias. We then apply the sigmoid activation function to this weighted sum to obtain the predicted probability that the "target" is 1. This probability is appended to the `output` list.

Finally, we convert the `output` list to a NumPy array and return it. This array contains the predicted probabilities for all rows in the input DataFrame.
