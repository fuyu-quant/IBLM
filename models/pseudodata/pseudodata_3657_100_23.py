Here is a simple Python code that uses a linear regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code assumes that the input 'x' is a pandas DataFrame with columns 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'target'.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []

    # Calculate the mean and standard deviation of each column
    mean_a = df['a'].mean()
    std_a = df['a'].std()
    mean_b = df['b'].mean()
    std_b = df['b'].std()
    mean_c = df['c'].mean()
    std_c = df['c'].std()
    mean_d = df['d'].mean()
    std_d = df['d'].std()

    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Normalize the data
        a = (row['a'] - mean_a) / std_a
        b = (row['b'] - mean_b) / std_b
        c = (row['c'] - mean_c) / std_c
        d = (row['d'] - mean_d) / std_d

        # Use a linear regression model to predict the probability
        y = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-(a + b + c + d)))

        output.append(y)

    return np.array(output)
```

This code first calculates the mean and standard deviation of each column in the DataFrame. Then, for each row in the DataFrame, it normalizes the data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. Finally, it uses a linear regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. The sigmoid function is used to ensure that the output is a probability between 0 and 1.
