Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        z = 0.1*row['a'] + 0.2*row['b'] + 0.3*row['c'] + 0.4*row['d']
        y = sigmoid(z)
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

In this code, the `sigmoid` function is used to map any real-valued number into the range between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as probabilities. The `predict` function applies this sigmoid function to a linear combination of the features 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' of each row in the input DataFrame `x`. The coefficients of this linear combination (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 in this case) are the parameters of the logistic regression model, which should be learned from the data. However, in this case, they are set arbitrarily, as the task does not provide a training procedure.

Please note that this code is a very simplified version of a logistic regression model and may not provide accurate predictions. For a more accurate model, you would need to use a more sophisticated method to learn the parameters from the data, such as gradient descent or maximum likelihood estimation, and possibly also include interaction terms and higher-order terms of the features.
