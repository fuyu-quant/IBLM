Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.1*row['a'] + 0.2*row['b'] + 0.3*row['c'] + 0.4*row['d']
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a sigmoid function, which is used in the logistic regression model to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1]. This is useful for transforming the linear regression output to a probability that the target class equals one.

The `predict` function then applies the logistic regression model to each row of the input DataFrame. The model is defined by the equation `z = 0.1*row['a'] + 0.2*row['b'] + 0.3*row['c'] + 0.4*row['d']`, where the coefficients (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) are arbitrary and should be learned from the data for a real-world application. The sigmoid of `z` is then computed to get the predicted probability that the target equals one.

Please note that this is a very basic implementation and may not give accurate results for complex datasets. For a real-world application, you would typically use a machine learning library like scikit-learn to train a logistic regression model on your data.
