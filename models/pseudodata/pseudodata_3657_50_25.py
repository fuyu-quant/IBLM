Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.1*row['a'] + 0.2*row['b'] + 0.3*row['c'] + 0.4*row['d']
        
        # Apply the sigmoid function to get the probability
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a sigmoid function, which is used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1], which can be interpreted as probabilities. Then, in the predict function, it applies a linear transformation to the input features 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' (with weights 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4, respectively), and applies the sigmoid function to the result to get the predicted probability. The weights in the linear transformation are arbitrary and should be learned from the data for a real application.

Please note that this is a very basic implementation and may not give accurate results. For a real application, you should use a more sophisticated method to learn the weights in the logistic regression model, such as gradient descent or maximum likelihood estimation, and possibly add a bias term and consider interaction terms and non-linear transformations of the input features.
