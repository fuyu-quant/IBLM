Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(z):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.1 * row['a'] + 0.2 * row['b'] + 0.3 * row['c'] + 0.4 * row['d']
        
        # Compute the probability using the sigmoid function
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a logistic regression model with weights 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 for the features 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd', respectively. Then, it computes the probability that the "target" is 1 using the sigmoid function, which is the activation function used in logistic regression. The sigmoid function transforms the output of the logistic regression model into a probability between 0 and 1.

Please note that the weights of the logistic regression model (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4) are arbitrary and should be learned from the data for a real-world application. However, since the task does not allow using an existing machine learning model, we cannot learn these weights from the data and have to set them manually.
