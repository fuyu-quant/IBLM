Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.1*row['a'] + 0.2*row['b'] + 0.3*row['c'] + 0.4*row['d']
        
        # Compute the probability using the sigmoid function
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a sigmoid function, which is used to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1], which can be interpreted as probabilities. Then, in the predict function, it applies a logistic regression model to each row of the input DataFrame. The logistic regression model is defined by a linear combination of the features 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd', with weights 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4, respectively. These weights are arbitrary and should be learned from the data for a real application. The output of the logistic regression model is then passed through the sigmoid function to obtain the probability that the "target" is 1. The probabilities are collected in the output list and returned as a numpy array.
