Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        z = 0.1*row['a'] + 0.2*row['b'] + 0.3*row['c'] + 0.4*row['d']
        y = sigmoid(z)
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

In this code, the `sigmoid` function is used to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1], which can be interpreted as probabilities. The `predict` function applies a linear transformation to the input features 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' (with weights 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4, respectively), and then applies the sigmoid function to the result to get the predicted probability. The weights in the linear transformation are arbitrary and should be learned from the data for a real-world application.

Please note that this is a very basic and naive implementation of logistic regression, and it's unlikely to give good results on real-world data. For a more accurate prediction, you should use a proper machine learning library like scikit-learn, which can learn the optimal weights from the data, handle more complex relationships between the features and the target variable, and provide many other useful features.
