Here is a simple Python code that uses a linear regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code assumes that the input 'x' is a pandas DataFrame with columns 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'target'.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []

    # Separate the features and the target
    features = df[['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']]
    target = df['target']

    # Train a linear regression model
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(features, target)

    # Predict the probabilities
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        y = model.predict([row[['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']]])
        output.append(y[0])

    return np.array(output)
```

This code first separates the features and the target from the input DataFrame. Then, it trains a linear regression model using these data. Finally, it uses the trained model to predict the probability of the target being 1 for each row in the input DataFrame.

Please note that this is a very simple model and may not provide the best accuracy. For better accuracy, you may want to consider using more advanced machine learning models and techniques, such as logistic regression, support vector machines, or neural networks.
