Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the weights for the logistic regression model
        weights = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4])
        
        # Calculate the weighted sum of the inputs
        weighted_sum = np.dot(row[:-1], weights)
        
        # Apply the sigmoid function to the weighted sum
        y = sigmoid(weighted_sum)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a sigmoid function, which is used in the logistic regression model to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1]. This is useful for transforming the linear regression output into a probability.

The `predict` function then iterates over each row in the input DataFrame `x`, calculates the weighted sum of the inputs (excluding the target column), applies the sigmoid function to the weighted sum to get the predicted probability, and appends this probability to the `output` list.

The weights for the logistic regression model are defined as a numpy array. These weights are arbitrary and should be learned from the data for a real-world application. However, for the purpose of this task, we simply set them to some arbitrary values.

Finally, the function returns the `output` list as a numpy array.
