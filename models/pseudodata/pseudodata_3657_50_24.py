Here is a simple Python code that uses a linear regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code assumes that the input `x` is a pandas DataFrame with the same structure as the data provided.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    model = LogisticRegression()
    model.fit(df[['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']], df['target'])
    output = model.predict_proba(df[['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']])[:,1]
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first trains a logistic regression model on the input data. The `fit` method is used to train the model, using the columns 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' as features and 'target' as the target variable. The `predict_proba` method is then used to predict the probability of the target being 1 for each row in the input data. The probabilities are returned as a numpy array.

Please note that this code uses the `sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` class, which is a commonly used machine learning model for binary classification problems. This model was chosen because it outputs probabilities, which is what the task requires. However, other models could be used instead, depending on the specific requirements of the task.
