Here is a simple Python code that uses a linear regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code assumes that the input `x` is a pandas DataFrame with the same structure as the data provided.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []

    # Calculate the mean and standard deviation of each column for target 0 and 1
    means_0 = df[df['target'] == 0].mean()
    stds_0 = df[df['target'] == 0].std()
    means_1 = df[df['target'] == 1].mean()
    stds_1 = df[df['target'] == 1].std()

    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Calculate the z-score for each column
        z_scores_0 = (row - means_0) / stds_0
        z_scores_1 = (row - means_1) / stds_1

        # Calculate the probability of the target being 0 or 1 using the z-scores
        prob_0 = np.exp(-0.5 * np.sum(z_scores_0**2)) / np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)**len(row)
        prob_1 = np.exp(-0.5 * np.sum(z_scores_1**2)) / np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)**len(row)

        # Normalize the probabilities so they sum to 1
        total_prob = prob_0 + prob_1
        prob_0 /= total_prob
        prob_1 /= total_prob

        # Append the probability of the target being 1 to the output
        output.append(prob_1)

    return np.array(output)
```

This code first calculates the mean and standard deviation of each column for the rows where the target is 0 and 1, respectively. Then, for each row in the DataFrame, it calculates the z-score for each column, which is the number of standard deviations that the value is away from the mean. The z-scores are used to calculate the probability of the target being 0 or 1 using the formula for the probability density function of a normal distribution. Finally, the probabilities are normalized so they sum to 1, and the probability of the target being 1 is appended to the output.
