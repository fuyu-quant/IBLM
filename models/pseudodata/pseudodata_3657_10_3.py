Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(z):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the weights for the logistic regression model
        weights = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4])
        
        # Calculate the weighted sum of the inputs
        z = np.dot(row[:-1], weights)
        
        # Apply the sigmoid function to the weighted sum
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a sigmoid function, which is used in the logistic regression model to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1]. This is useful for transforming the linear regression output to a probability that the target class equals one.

In the predict function, we first copy the input DataFrame to avoid modifying the original data. Then, for each row in the DataFrame, we calculate the weighted sum of the inputs (excluding the target column) using some predefined weights. We then apply the sigmoid function to this sum to get the predicted probability that the target equals one. This probability is then appended to the output list.

Please note that the weights in this code are arbitrary and would normally be learned from the data using a learning algorithm. However, as the task does not allow the use of existing machine learning models, we have to define them manually.
