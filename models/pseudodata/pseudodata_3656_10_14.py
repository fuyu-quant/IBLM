Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        z = 0.1*row['a'] + 0.2*row['b'] + 0.3*row['c'] + 0.4*row['d']
        y = sigmoid(z)
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)

# Test the function
data = {
    'a': [0.65, 0.05, -1.72, -0.76, -1.69, -0.15, 1.24, 1.14, -0.42, 2.33],
    'b': [0.66, -0.43, 0.17, -0.32, 0.75, -0.56, 0.18, 0.07, 0.62, 0.0],
    'c': [2.23, -1.06, -1.02, -1.47, 0.48, -1.56, 1.52, 1.16, 1.22, 1.98],
    'd': [1.39, -1.02, 0.84, -0.57, 2.2, -1.28, 0.12, -0.12, 1.57, -0.59],
    'target': [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(predict(df))
```

Please note that the weights (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) used in the logistic regression model are arbitrary and should be learned from the data for a real-world application.
