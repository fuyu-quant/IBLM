Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.1*row['a'] + 0.2*row['b'] + 0.3*row['c'] + 0.4*row['d']
        
        # Compute the probability using the sigmoid function
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

In this code, the logistic regression model is defined by the function `z = 0.1*a + 0.2*b + 0.3*c + 0.4*d`, where `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are the features of the data. The coefficients (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) are arbitrary and should be determined based on the data. The sigmoid function is used to convert the output of the logistic regression model to a probability between 0 and 1. The predicted probability is then appended to the output list.
