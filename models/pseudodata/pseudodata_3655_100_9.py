Here is a simple Python code that uses a linear regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code assumes that the input 'x' is a pandas DataFrame with columns 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'target'.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    model = LogisticRegression()
    model.fit(df[['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']], df['target'])
    probabilities = model.predict_proba(df[['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']])
    return probabilities[:, 1]
```

This code first trains a logistic regression model on the input data. The model is trained to predict the 'target' column based on the 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' columns. After the model is trained, it is used to predict the probabilities of the target being 1 for each row in the input data. The probabilities are returned as a numpy array.

Please note that this code uses the LogisticRegression class from the sklearn.linear_model module, which is a commonly used machine learning library in Python. The LogisticRegression class implements logistic regression, a simple and widely used machine learning model for binary classification problems.
