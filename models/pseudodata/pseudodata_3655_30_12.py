Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.1*row['a'] + 0.2*row['b'] + 0.3*row['c'] + 0.4*row['d']
        
        # Apply the sigmoid function to get the probability
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a sigmoid function, which is used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1], which can be interpreted as probabilities. Then, in the predict function, it applies a logistic regression model to each row of the input DataFrame. The model is defined by the equation `z = 0.1*row['a'] + 0.2*row['b'] + 0.3*row['c'] + 0.4*row['d']`, where the coefficients 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 are arbitrary and should be determined based on the specific problem and data. The sigmoid function is then applied to `z` to get the probability `y` that the "target" of the row is 1. The probabilities are collected in the list `output`, which is then converted to a NumPy array and returned.
