Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.1*row['a'] + 0.2*row['b'] - 0.3*row['c'] - 0.4*row['d']
        
        # Compute the probability using the sigmoid function
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a sigmoid function, which is used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1]. This function is then used to compute the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1, based on the values of the features 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The weights (0.1, 0.2, -0.3, -0.4) used in the logistic regression model are arbitrary and should be learned from the data for a real-world application.

Please note that this is a very basic implementation and may not provide accurate predictions. For a more accurate model, you should consider using a machine learning library like scikit-learn, which provides more sophisticated methods for logistic regression, including regularization and optimization algorithms.
