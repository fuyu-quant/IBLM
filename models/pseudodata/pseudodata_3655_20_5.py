Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.

        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.1*row['a'] + 0.2*row['b'] + 0.3*row['c'] + 0.4*row['d']
        y = sigmoid(z)

        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

In this code, the logistic regression model is defined by the function `sigmoid(z)`, where `z` is a linear combination of the features 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The coefficients of the features (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) are chosen arbitrarily and should be adjusted to fit the data better. The sigmoid function transforms the output of the linear model to a probability between 0 and 1.

Please note that this is a very basic implementation and does not include any form of model training or optimization. For a more accurate prediction, you would need to train the model on your data, for example by using gradient descent to find the optimal coefficients.
