Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.1*row['a'] + 0.2*row['b'] + 0.3*row['c'] + 0.4*row['d']
        
        # Compute the probability using the sigmoid function
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a sigmoid function, which is used to map any real-valued number into the range between 0 and 1. This function is used in the logistic regression model to compute the probability of the "target" being 1.

In the predict function, the logistic regression model is defined as a linear combination of the input features 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd', with weights 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4, respectively. These weights are arbitrary and should be learned from the data for a real-world application.

The probability of the "target" being 1 is then computed by applying the sigmoid function to the output of the logistic regression model. This probability is appended to the output list, which is finally returned as a numpy array.

Please note that this code is a very basic implementation of a logistic regression model and does not include any form of model training or parameter optimization. For a real-world application, you would need to split your data into a training set and a test set, learn the weights of the logistic regression model from the training data, and evaluate the performance of the model on the test data.
