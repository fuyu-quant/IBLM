Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        z = 0.1*row['a'] + 0.2*row['b'] + 0.3*row['c'] + 0.4*row['d']
        y = sigmoid(z)
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

In this code, the `sigmoid` function is used to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1], which can be interpreted as probabilities. The `predict` function applies a linear transformation to the input features 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' (with weights 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4, respectively), and then applies the sigmoid function to the result to get the predicted probability.

Please note that the weights (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) used in this code are arbitrary and for illustrative purposes only. In a real-world scenario, these weights would be learned from the data using a learning algorithm.
