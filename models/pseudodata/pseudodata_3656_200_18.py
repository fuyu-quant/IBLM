Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any machine learning libraries, but instead implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.1 * row['a'] + 0.2 * row['b'] + 0.3 * row['c'] + 0.4 * row['d']
        
        # Apply the sigmoid function to get the probability
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

In this code, the `sigmoid` function is used to convert the output of the linear regression model into a probability between 0 and 1. The weights (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) in the linear regression model are arbitrary and should be adjusted based on the actual data.

Please note that this is a very basic model and may not provide accurate predictions for complex datasets. For more accurate predictions, you may need to use more advanced machine learning models and techniques.
