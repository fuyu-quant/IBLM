Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        z = row['a'] * 0.1 + row['b'] * 0.2 + row['c'] * 0.3 + row['d'] * 0.4
        y = sigmoid(z)
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

In this code, the `sigmoid` function is used to map any real-valued number into the range between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as probabilities. The `predict` function calculates a linear combination of the input features (a, b, c, d) with some weights (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4), and then applies the sigmoid function to this sum to get the predicted probability. The weights in this linear combination are chosen arbitrarily, and in a real-world scenario, they should be learned from the data using a learning algorithm.

Please note that this is a very basic and naive implementation of logistic regression, and it may not give accurate predictions. For more accurate predictions, you should use a more sophisticated machine learning model and learn the model parameters from the data.
