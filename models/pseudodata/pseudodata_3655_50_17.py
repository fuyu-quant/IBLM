Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code does not use any machine learning libraries, but instead implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the weights for the logistic regression model
        weights = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4])
        
        # Calculate the weighted sum of the inputs
        weighted_sum = np.dot(row[:-1], weights)
        
        # Apply the sigmoid function to the weighted sum
        y = sigmoid(weighted_sum)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a sigmoid function, which is used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1], which can be interpreted as probabilities. Then, in the predict function, it calculates the weighted sum of the inputs for each row in the dataframe, applies the sigmoid function to this sum to get the predicted probability, and appends this probability to the output list.

Please note that the weights in this code are arbitrarily chosen and would normally be learned from the data using a method such as gradient descent. However, since the task specifies not to use an existing machine learning model, I have chosen arbitrary weights for the purpose of this example.
