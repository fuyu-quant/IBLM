Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.1*row['a'] + 0.2*row['b'] + 0.3*row['c'] + 0.4*row['d']
        
        # Compute the probability using the sigmoid function
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a sigmoid function, which is used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1], which can be interpreted as probabilities. Then, in the predict function, it applies the logistic regression model to each row of the input DataFrame. The coefficients of the model (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) are chosen arbitrarily and should be adjusted based on the actual data to improve the accuracy of the predictions. The computed probability is then appended to the output list, which is finally returned as a numpy array.

Please note that this is a very basic implementation and may not provide accurate predictions. For more accurate predictions, you should consider using a more sophisticated machine learning model and properly train it on your data.
