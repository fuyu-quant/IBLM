Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(z):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        z = row['a'] + row['b'] - row['c'] - row['d']
        y = sigmoid(z)
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a helper function `sigmoid` which is used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1], which can be interpreted as probabilities. Then, in the `predict` function, for each row in the dataframe, it calculates a linear combination of the features 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd', and applies the sigmoid function to this value to get the predicted probability of the target being 1. The weights of the features in the linear combination are set to 1 for 'a' and 'b' and -1 for 'c' and 'd', assuming that 'a' and 'b' have a positive effect on the target being 1 and 'c' and 'd' have a negative effect. These weights can be adjusted based on further analysis of the data.
