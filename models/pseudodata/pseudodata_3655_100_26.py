Here is a simple Python code that uses a linear regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code assumes that the input 'x' is a pandas DataFrame with columns 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'target'.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []

    # Separate the features and the target
    features = df[['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']]
    target = df['target']

    # Train a linear regression model
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(features, target)

    # Predict the probabilities
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        y = model.predict([row[['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']]])
        output.append(y[0])

    return np.array(output)
```

This code first separates the features and the target from the input DataFrame. It then trains a linear regression model using these data. The model is used to predict the probability of the target being 1 for each row in the DataFrame. The predicted probabilities are stored in the 'output' list, which is then converted to a numpy array and returned.

Please note that this is a very simple model and may not provide accurate predictions for complex data. For more accurate predictions, you may need to use a more sophisticated model and perform feature engineering.
