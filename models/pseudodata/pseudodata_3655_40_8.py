Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        z = 0.1*row['a'] + 0.2*row['b'] + 0.3*row['c'] + 0.4*row['d']
        y = sigmoid(z)
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

In this code, the `sigmoid` function is used to map any real-valued number into another value between 0 and 1. In machine learning, we use sigmoid to map predictions to probabilities.

The `predict` function applies the logistic regression model to each row of the input DataFrame. The model is defined by the equation `z = 0.1*a + 0.2*b + 0.3*c + 0.4*d`, where `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are the values of the corresponding columns in the DataFrame. The coefficients (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) are chosen arbitrarily and should be learned from the data for a real-world application.

The output of the model is the sigmoid of `z`, which is a number between 0 and 1 that can be interpreted as the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. The function returns an array of these probabilities, one for each row in the input DataFrame.
