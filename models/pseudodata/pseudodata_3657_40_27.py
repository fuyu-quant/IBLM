Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        z = 0.1 * row['a'] + 0.2 * row['b'] + 0.3 * row['c'] + 0.4 * row['d']
        y = sigmoid(z)
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

In this code, the `sigmoid` function is used to map any real-valued number into the range between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as probabilities. The `predict` function applies a linear transformation to the input features 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' and then applies the sigmoid function to the result to get the predicted probability. The coefficients in the linear transformation (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4) are arbitrary and should be learned from the data for a real-world application.

Please note that this is a very basic and naive implementation of logistic regression and it's not suitable for real-world applications where the relationship between the input features and the target variable might be more complex. For real-world applications, it's recommended to use a more sophisticated machine learning model and a proper machine learning library such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow.
