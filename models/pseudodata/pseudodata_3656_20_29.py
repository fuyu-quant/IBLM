Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the weights for the logistic regression model
        weights = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4])
        
        # Calculate the weighted sum of inputs
        weighted_sum = np.dot(row[:-1], weights)
        
        # Apply the sigmoid function to the weighted sum
        y = sigmoid(weighted_sum)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a sigmoid function, which is used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1]. This is useful for transforming the linear regression output into a probability.

The `predict` function then applies this logistic regression model to each row of the input DataFrame. It calculates the weighted sum of the input features (excluding the target) using some predefined weights, and then applies the sigmoid function to this sum to get the predicted probability that the target is 1.

Please note that the weights used in this code are arbitrary and for illustrative purposes only. In a real-world scenario, these weights would be learned from the data using a training algorithm.
