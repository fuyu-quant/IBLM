Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        z = row['a'] + row['b'] - row['c'] - row['d']
        y = sigmoid(z)
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a helper function `sigmoid(x)` that implements the sigmoid function, which is used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1]. This function is then used in the `predict(x)` function to compute the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1.

The `predict(x)` function iterates over each row in the input DataFrame `x`, computes a linear combination of the features 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd', and then applies the sigmoid function to this linear combination to obtain the predicted probability. The predicted probabilities are then returned as a NumPy array.

Please note that this is a very basic implementation of logistic regression and may not provide accurate predictions if the relationship between the features and the target variable is not linear or if there are interactions between the features. For more accurate predictions, a more sophisticated machine learning model may be needed.
