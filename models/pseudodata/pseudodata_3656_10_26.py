Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.1*row['a'] + 0.2*row['b'] + 0.3*row['c'] + 0.4*row['d']
        
        # Apply the sigmoid function to get the probability
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a logistic regression model with some arbitrary weights (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) for the features 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'. Then it applies the sigmoid function to the output of the model to get the probability that the "target" is 1. The sigmoid function is commonly used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1], which can be interpreted as probabilities.

Please note that this is a very basic implementation and the weights of the logistic regression model are arbitrarily chosen. In a real-world scenario, you would want to train the model on your data to learn the optimal weights.
