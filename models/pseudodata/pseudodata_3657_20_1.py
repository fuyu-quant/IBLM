Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.

        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.1*row['a'] + 0.2*row['b'] + 0.3*row['c'] + 0.4*row['d']
        y = sigmoid(z)

        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

In this code, the logistic regression model is defined by the function `sigmoid(z)`, where `z` is a linear combination of the features 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'. The coefficients of the linear combination (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) are chosen arbitrarily and should be adjusted based on the actual data to improve the accuracy of the prediction.

The `sigmoid(z)` function transforms the output of the linear combination into a probability between 0 and 1, which represents the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1.

Please note that this is a very basic implementation of a logistic regression model and does not include any feature scaling, regularization, or optimization of the coefficients, which are usually necessary to achieve good prediction accuracy.
