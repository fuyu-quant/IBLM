Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        z = row['a'] + row['b'] - row['c'] - row['d']
        y = sigmoid(z)
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a helper function `sigmoid` that implements the sigmoid function, which is used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1]. This function is then used in the `predict` function to compute the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1.

The `predict` function takes as input a DataFrame `x` and returns a numpy array of probabilities. For each row in the DataFrame, it computes a linear combination of the features 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd', and then applies the sigmoid function to this linear combination to obtain a probability. The sign of the coefficients in the linear combination is chosen based on the assumption that higher values of 'a' and 'b' and lower values of 'c' and 'd' are associated with a higher probability of the "target" being 1. This assumption may need to be adjusted based on the specific characteristics of the data.
