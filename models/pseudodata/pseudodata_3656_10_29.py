Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.1*row['a'] + 0.2*row['b'] + 0.3*row['c'] + 0.4*row['d']
        
        # Apply the sigmoid function to get the probability
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

In this code, the logistic regression model is defined by the function `z = 0.1*row['a'] + 0.2*row['b'] + 0.3*row['c'] + 0.4*row['d']`. The coefficients (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) are arbitrary and should be adjusted based on the actual data to improve the accuracy of the prediction. The sigmoid function is then applied to `z` to get the probability `y` that the "target" is 1.

Please note that this is a very basic implementation and may not provide accurate predictions for complex data. For more accurate predictions, you may need to use more advanced machine learning models and techniques.
