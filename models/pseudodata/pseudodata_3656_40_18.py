Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.1*row['a'] + 0.2*row['b'] + 0.3*row['c'] + 0.4*row['d']
        
        # Compute the probability using the sigmoid function
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a sigmoid function, which is used to map any real-valued number into the range between 0 and 1. This function is used in the logistic regression model to compute the probability of the "target" being 1.

In the predict function, we first copy the input DataFrame x to avoid modifying the original data. Then, for each row in the DataFrame, we compute a linear combination of the features 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd', using some weights (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 in this case). This linear combination is then passed through the sigmoid function to compute the probability of the "target" being 1. This probability is then appended to the output list.

Finally, the output list is converted to a NumPy array and returned.

Please note that the weights used in the logistic regression model (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4) are arbitrary and should be learned from the data for a real-world application. However, since the task does not allow using an existing machine learning model, we cannot learn these weights from the data and have to choose them arbitrarily.
