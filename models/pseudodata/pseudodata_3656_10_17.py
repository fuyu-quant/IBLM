Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.1*row['a'] + 0.2*row['b'] + 0.3*row['c'] + 0.4*row['d']
        
        # Compute the probability using the sigmoid function
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a sigmoid function, which is used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1]. This is useful for transforming the output of the logistic regression model into a probability.

The `predict` function then applies the logistic regression model to each row of the input DataFrame. The model is defined by the equation `z = 0.1*row['a'] + 0.2*row['b'] + 0.3*row['c'] + 0.4*row['d']`. These coefficients (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4) are arbitrary and should be learned from the data for a real application.

The probability `y` is then computed by applying the sigmoid function to `z`. This probability is appended to the `output` list, which is returned as a numpy array at the end of the function.

Please note that this is a very basic implementation and may not give accurate results for complex datasets. For a real application, you should use a machine learning library like scikit-learn, which provides more sophisticated methods for logistic regression and other classification tasks.
