Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        z = 0.1 * row['a'] + 0.2 * row['b'] + 0.3 * row['c'] + 0.4 * row['d']
        y = sigmoid(z)
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)

# Test the function
data = {
    'a': [0.71, -0.25, 0.22, -0.64, 2.04],
    'b': [-1.08, 0.49, -0.0, 1.27, 2.13],
    'c': [-0.83, 0.32, -0.16, 0.83, -0.86],
    'd': [-1.21, 0.51, -0.12, 1.31, 0.47],
    'target': [1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(predict(df))
```

This code first defines a helper function `sigmoid(x)` that implements the sigmoid function, which is used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1]. This function is then used in the `predict(x)` function to compute the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1.

The `predict(x)` function iterates over the rows of the input DataFrame `x`, computes a linear combination of the features 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' with some weights (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4, respectively, in this example), and applies the sigmoid function to this linear combination to obtain the probability that the "target" is 1. This probability is then appended to the output list.

Finally, the function returns the output list as a NumPy array.

Please note that this is a very basic implementation and the weights used in the linear combination are arbitrary. In a real-world scenario, these weights would be learned from the data using a learning algorithm.
