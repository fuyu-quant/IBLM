Here is a simple Python code that uses a linear regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code assumes that the input 'x' is a pandas DataFrame with columns 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'target'.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []

    # Split the data into features and target
    features = df[['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']]
    target = df['target']

    # Train a logistic regression model
    model = LogisticRegression()
    model.fit(features, target)

    # Predict the probability of the target being 1
    probabilities = model.predict_proba(features)[:, 1]

    return probabilities
```

This code first splits the data into features and target. Then, it trains a logistic regression model on this data. Finally, it uses the trained model to predict the probability of the target being 1 for each data point.

Please note that this code uses the sklearn library's LogisticRegression model, which is a commonly used model for binary classification problems. This model assumes that there is a linear relationship between the features and the log-odds of the target being 1.
