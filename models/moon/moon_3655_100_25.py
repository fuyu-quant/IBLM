Here is a simple Python code that uses a linear regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code assumes that the input 'x' is a pandas DataFrame with columns 'Feature_1', 'Feature_2', and 'target'.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []

    # Calculate the mean and standard deviation of each feature for each target value
    mean_0 = df[df['target'] == 0][['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']].mean()
    std_0 = df[df['target'] == 0][['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']].std()
    mean_1 = df[df['target'] == 1][['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']].mean()
    std_1 = df[df['target'] == 1][['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']].std()

    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Calculate the z-score for each feature
        z_0 = (row[['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']] - mean_0) / std_0
        z_1 = (row[['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']] - mean_1) / std_1

        # Calculate the probability of the target being 0 or 1 using the z-scores
        p_0 = np.exp(-0.5 * np.sum(z_0**2)) / (2 * np.pi * np.prod(std_0))
        p_1 = np.exp(-0.5 * np.sum(z_1**2)) / (2 * np.pi * np.prod(std_1))

        # Normalize the probabilities so they sum to 1
        p_sum = p_0 + p_1
        p_0 /= p_sum
        p_1 /= p_sum

        # Append the probability of the target being 1 to the output
        output.append(p_1)

    return np.array(output)
```

This code first calculates the mean and standard deviation of each feature for each target value. Then, for each row in the DataFrame, it calculates the z-score for each feature, which is the number of standard deviations that the feature value is from the mean. The z-scores are used to calculate the probability of the target being 0 or 1 using the formula for the probability density function of a normal distribution. The probabilities are then normalized so they sum to 1, and the probability of the target being 1 is appended to the output.
