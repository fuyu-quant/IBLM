Here is a simple Python code that uses a linear regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code assumes that the input 'x' is a pandas DataFrame with columns 'Feature_1', 'Feature_2', and 'target'.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []

    # Calculate the mean and standard deviation of each feature for each target class
    means = df.groupby('target').mean()
    stds = df.groupby('target').std()

    # Calculate the prior probabilities of each target class
    priors = df['target'].value_counts() / len(df)

    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Calculate the likelihood of the data given each target class
        likelihood_0 = np.prod(np.exp(-(row[['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']] - means.loc[0])**2 / (2 * stds.loc[0]**2)) / np.sqrt(2 * np.pi * stds.loc[0]**2))
        likelihood_1 = np.prod(np.exp(-(row[['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']] - means.loc[1])**2 / (2 * stds.loc[1]**2)) / np.sqrt(2 * np.pi * stds.loc[1]**2))

        # Calculate the posterior probabilities of each target class
        posterior_0 = likelihood_0 * priors[0]
        posterior_1 = likelihood_1 * priors[1]

        # Normalize the posterior probabilities so they sum to 1
        total = posterior_0 + posterior_1
        posterior_0 /= total
        posterior_1 /= total

        # Append the probability of the target being 1 to the output
        output.append(posterior_1)

    return np.array(output)
```

This code uses a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier to predict the probability of the target being 1. It first calculates the mean and standard deviation of each feature for each target class, as well as the prior probabilities of each target class. Then, for each row in the DataFrame, it calculates the likelihood of the data given each target class and multiplies this by the prior probabilities to get the posterior probabilities. Finally, it normalizes the posterior probabilities so they sum to 1 and appends the probability of the target being 1 to the output.
