Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the coefficients for the logistic regression model
        coef = np.array([0.4, 0.6])  # These values should be determined based on the data
        
        # Calculate the linear combination of the features and the coefficients
        z = np.dot(row[['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']], coef)
        
        # Apply the sigmoid function to get the probability
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

Please note that the coefficients of the logistic regression model (i.e., the `coef` variable in the code) should be determined based on the data. In this code, I just used arbitrary values for the coefficients. In a real-world scenario, you would need to train the logistic regression model on your data to find the best coefficients.
