Here is a simple Python code that uses a linear regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code assumes that the input 'x' is a pandas DataFrame with columns 'Feature_1', 'Feature_2', and 'target'.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []

    # Calculate the mean and standard deviation of each feature for target 0 and 1
    mean_0 = df[df['target'] == 0][['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']].mean()
    std_0 = df[df['target'] == 0][['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']].std()
    mean_1 = df[df['target'] == 1][['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']].mean()
    std_1 = df[df['target'] == 1][['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']].std()

    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Calculate the probability of the data point under the Gaussian distribution for target 0 and 1
        prob_0 = np.exp(-((row[['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']] - mean_0) ** 2 / (2 * std_0 ** 2)).sum()) / (np.sqrt(2 * np.pi) * std_0).prod()
        prob_1 = np.exp(-((row[['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']] - mean_1) ** 2 / (2 * std_1 ** 2)).sum()) / (np.sqrt(2 * np.pi) * std_1).prod()

        # Use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of target 1
        y = prob_1 / (prob_0 + prob_1)
        output.append(y)

    return np.array(output)
```

This code uses a simple Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier to predict the probability of the target being 1. It first calculates the mean and standard deviation of each feature for target 0 and 1. Then, for each data point, it calculates the probability of the data point under the Gaussian distribution for target 0 and 1. Finally, it uses Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of target 1.
