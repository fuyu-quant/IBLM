Here is a simple Python code that uses a linear regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code assumes that the input 'x' is a pandas DataFrame with columns 'Feature_1', 'Feature_2', and 'target'.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []

    # Calculate the mean and standard deviation of each feature for each target value
    mean_0 = df[df['target'] == 0][['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']].mean()
    std_0 = df[df['target'] == 0][['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']].std()
    mean_1 = df[df['target'] == 1][['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']].mean()
    std_1 = df[df['target'] == 1][['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']].std()

    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Calculate the probability of the data point belonging to each target value
        prob_0 = np.exp(-((row[['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']] - mean_0) ** 2 / (2 * std_0 ** 2)).sum())
        prob_1 = np.exp(-((row[['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']] - mean_1) ** 2 / (2 * std_1 ** 2)).sum())

        # Normalize the probabilities so they sum to 1
        total_prob = prob_0 + prob_1
        prob_0 /= total_prob
        prob_1 /= total_prob

        # Append the probability of the target being 1 to the output
        output.append(prob_1)

    return np.array(output)
```

This code uses a Gaussian naive Bayes classifier to predict the probability of the target being 1. It assumes that the features are normally distributed and that they are independent given the target value. The code calculates the mean and standard deviation of each feature for each target value, and then uses these parameters to calculate the probability of each data point belonging to each target value. The probabilities are then normalized so they sum to 1. The code returns the probability of the target being 1 for each data point.
