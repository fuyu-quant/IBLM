Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.4 * row['Feature_1'] + 0.6 * row['Feature_2'] - 0.5
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a helper function `sigmoid` that implements the sigmoid function, which is used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1]. This function is then used in the `predict` function to compute the predicted probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1.

The logistic regression model is defined in the `predict` function with the equation `z = 0.4 * row['Feature_1'] + 0.6 * row['Feature_2'] - 0.5`. The coefficients 0.4 and 0.6 are the weights of the features 'Feature_1' and 'Feature_2', respectively, and -0.5 is the bias term. These values are arbitrary and should be adjusted based on the specific data.

The predicted probability `y` is then computed by applying the sigmoid function to `z`. The resulting value is a probability between 0 and 1, which is appended to the `output` list. The function finally returns the `output` list as a numpy array.
