Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        # Here we use a simple logistic regression model with weights w1, w2 and bias b
        # The weights and bias are chosen arbitrarily for this example
        w1, w2, b = 0.1, 0.2, 0.5
        z = w1*row['Feature_1'] + w2*row['Feature_2'] + b
        y = sigmoid(z)
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a helper function `sigmoid` which is used in the logistic regression model. The `predict` function then applies this model to each row of the input DataFrame `x`. The model parameters (weights `w1`, `w2` and bias `b`) are chosen arbitrarily for this example. In a real-world application, these parameters would be learned from the data.

The output of the `predict` function is an array of probabilities that the "target" of each row in the input DataFrame is 1. These probabilities are computed by applying the sigmoid function to a linear combination of the features and the bias. The sigmoid function ensures that these probabilities are between 0 and 1.
