Here is a simple Python code that uses a linear regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code assumes that the input 'x' is a pandas DataFrame with columns 'Feature_1' and 'Feature_2'.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []

    # Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the features for target 0 and 1
    mean_0 = df[df['target'] == 0][['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']].mean()
    std_0 = df[df['target'] == 0][['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']].std()
    mean_1 = df[df['target'] == 1][['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']].mean()
    std_1 = df[df['target'] == 1][['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']].std()

    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Calculate the z-score for the features
        z_0 = (row[['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']] - mean_0) / std_0
        z_1 = (row[['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']] - mean_1) / std_1

        # Calculate the probability of the target being 0 or 1 using the Gaussian distribution
        p_0 = np.exp(-z_0**2 / 2) / np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)
        p_1 = np.exp(-z_1**2 / 2) / np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)

        # The predicted probability of the target being 1 is the ratio of p_1 to the sum of p_0 and p_1
        y = p_1 / (p_0 + p_1)

        output.append(y)

    return np.array(output)
```

This code calculates the z-score of the features for each row in the DataFrame, and then uses the Gaussian distribution to calculate the probability of the target being 0 or 1. The predicted probability of the target being 1 is the ratio of the probability of the target being 1 to the sum of the probabilities of the target being 0 and 1.
