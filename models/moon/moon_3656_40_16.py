Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Define the sigmoid function
def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

# Define the logistic regression model
def logistic_regression(x, w, b):
    return sigmoid(np.dot(x, w) + b)

# Define the predict function
def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Extract the features
        features = np.array([row['Feature_1'], row['Feature_2']])
        # Define the weights and bias (these values should be learned from the data)
        weights = np.array([0.1, 0.2])
        bias = -0.3
        # Compute the prediction
        y = logistic_regression(features, weights, bias)
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a sigmoid function, which is used in the logistic regression model to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1]. Then, it defines the logistic regression model, which takes as input the features of a data point, the weights of the model, and a bias term, and outputs a probability between 0 and 1.

Finally, it defines the predict function, which takes as input a DataFrame containing the data to be predicted. For each row in the DataFrame, it extracts the features, computes the prediction using the logistic regression model, and appends the prediction to the output list. The function returns the output list as a NumPy array.

Please note that the weights and bias in the logistic regression model are set to arbitrary values in this code. In a real-world scenario, these values should be learned from the data using a learning algorithm.
