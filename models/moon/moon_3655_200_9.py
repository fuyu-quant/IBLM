Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        z = 0.1 * row['Feature_1'] + 0.9 * row['Feature_2']  # weights are assumed to be 0.1 and 0.9 for simplicity
        y = sigmoid(z)
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a helper function `sigmoid` that implements the sigmoid function, which is used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1]. This function is then used in the `predict` function to compute the predicted probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1.

In the `predict` function, we iterate over each row in the input DataFrame `df`. For each row, we compute a linear combination of the features 'Feature_1' and 'Feature_2' with some weights (assumed to be 0.1 and 0.9 for simplicity), and then apply the sigmoid function to this linear combination to get the predicted probability. This predicted probability is then appended to the output list.

Finally, the `predict` function returns the output list as a numpy array.

Please note that this is a very simple and naive implementation of logistic regression, and the weights used in the linear combination are just assumed for simplicity. In a real-world scenario, you would typically use a more sophisticated method to learn these weights from the data, such as gradient descent.
