Here is a simple Python code that uses a linear regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code assumes that the input 'x' is a pandas DataFrame with columns 'Feature_1', 'Feature_2', and 'target'.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []

    # Calculate the mean and standard deviation of each feature for target 0 and 1
    mean_0 = df[df['target'] == 0][['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']].mean()
    std_0 = df[df['target'] == 0][['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']].std()
    mean_1 = df[df['target'] == 1][['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']].mean()
    std_1 = df[df['target'] == 1][['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']].std()

    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Calculate the probability of the data point belonging to target 0 and 1
        prob_0 = np.exp(-((row[['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']] - mean_0) ** 2 / (2 * std_0 ** 2)).sum())
        prob_1 = np.exp(-((row[['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']] - mean_1) ** 2 / (2 * std_1 ** 2)).sum())

        # Normalize the probabilities so they sum to 1
        total_prob = prob_0 + prob_1
        prob_0 /= total_prob
        prob_1 /= total_prob

        # Append the probability of the target being 1 to the output
        output.append(prob_1)

    return np.array(output)
```

This code uses a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier to predict the probability of the target being 1. It calculates the mean and standard deviation of each feature for target 0 and 1, and then uses the Gaussian probability density function to calculate the probability of each data point belonging to target 0 and 1. The probabilities are then normalized so they sum to 1. The probability of the target being 1 is appended to the output.
