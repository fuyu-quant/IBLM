Here is a simple Python code that uses a linear regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code assumes that the input 'x' is a pandas DataFrame with columns 'Feature_1', 'Feature_2', and 'target'.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []

    # Calculate the mean and standard deviation of each feature for each target value
    means = df.groupby('target').mean()
    stds = df.groupby('target').std()

    # Calculate the probability of each row belonging to target 1
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Calculate the z-score for each feature
        z1 = (row['Feature_1'] - means.loc[1, 'Feature_1']) / stds.loc[1, 'Feature_1']
        z2 = (row['Feature_2'] - means.loc[1, 'Feature_2']) / stds.loc[1, 'Feature_2']

        # Calculate the probability of the row belonging to target 1 using the standard normal distribution
        p1 = np.exp(-z1**2 / 2) / np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)
        p2 = np.exp(-z2**2 / 2) / np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)

        # The final probability is the product of the two probabilities
        y = p1 * p2

        output.append(y)

    return np.array(output)
```

This code calculates the z-score for each feature in each row, which is a measure of how many standard deviations away from the mean the feature value is. It then calculates the probability of the row belonging to target 1 using the standard normal distribution, which assumes that the data is normally distributed. The final probability is the product of the two probabilities.

Please note that this is a very simple model and may not provide accurate predictions if the data is not normally distributed or if the features are not independent. For more accurate predictions, a more complex model such as logistic regression or a neural network may be needed.
