Here is a simple Python code that uses a linear regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code assumes that the input 'x' is a pandas DataFrame with columns 'Feature_1' and 'Feature_2'.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.

        # Simple linear regression model
        y = 0.5 * row['Feature_1'] + 0.5 * row['Feature_2']

        # Convert the output to a probability between 0 and 1
        y = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-y))

        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first calculates a linear combination of the features 'Feature_1' and 'Feature_2' with equal weights of 0.5. Then, it applies the logistic function to convert the output to a probability between 0 and 1. The logistic function is commonly used in logistic regression models to predict probabilities.

Please note that this is a very simple model and may not provide accurate predictions for complex datasets. For more accurate predictions, you may need to use more advanced machine learning models and techniques.
