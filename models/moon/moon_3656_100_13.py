Here is a simple Python code that uses a logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        z = 0.4 * row['Feature_1'] + 0.6 * row['Feature_2']  # weights are assumed to be 0.4 and 0.6 for simplicity
        y = sigmoid(z)
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a helper function `sigmoid` that implements the sigmoid function, which is used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1]. This function is then used in the `predict` function to compute the predicted probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1.

The `predict` function takes as input a DataFrame `x` and returns a numpy array of predicted probabilities. For each row in the DataFrame, it computes a linear combination of the features 'Feature_1' and 'Feature_2' with weights 0.4 and 0.6, respectively. The result is then passed through the sigmoid function to obtain the predicted probability.

Please note that the weights 0.4 and 0.6 are assumed for simplicity. In a real-world scenario, these weights would be learned from the data using a learning algorithm.
