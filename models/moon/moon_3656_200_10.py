Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(z):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        z = row['Feature_1'] + row['Feature_2']
        y = sigmoid(z)
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a helper function `sigmoid(z)` that implements the sigmoid function, which is used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1]. This function is then used in the `predict(x)` function to compute the predicted probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1.

The `predict(x)` function iterates over each row in the input DataFrame `x`, computes the sum of the values in the 'Feature_1' and 'Feature_2' columns, and passes this sum to the `sigmoid(z)` function to compute the predicted probability. This probability is then appended to the `output` list, which is finally converted to a NumPy array and returned.

Please note that this is a very basic implementation of logistic regression and may not provide accurate predictions for complex datasets. For more accurate predictions, you may need to use a more sophisticated machine learning model and/or perform feature engineering on your data.
