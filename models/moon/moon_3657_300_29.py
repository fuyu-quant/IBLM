Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.4 * row['Feature_1'] - 0.6 * row['Feature_2'] + 0.5
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a sigmoid function, which is used in the logistic regression model to map any real-valued number into another value between 0 and 1. In the logistic regression model, the output can be interpreted as the probability of a particular class or event.

Then, in the `predict` function, for each row in the dataframe, it calculates the linear combination of the features 'Feature_1' and 'Feature_2' with some weights (0.4 and -0.6 in this case), and adds a bias term (0.5 in this case). This value is then passed through the sigmoid function to get the predicted probability that the "target" is 1.

Please note that the weights (0.4 and -0.6) and the bias term (0.5) in this code are arbitrary and for demonstration purposes only. In a real-world scenario, these parameters should be learned from the data using a learning algorithm.
