Here is a simple Python code that uses a linear regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code assumes that the input 'x' is a pandas DataFrame with columns 'Feature_1', 'Feature_2', and 'target'.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []

    # Calculate the mean and standard deviation of each feature for each target value
    mean_0 = df[df['target'] == 0][['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']].mean()
    std_0 = df[df['target'] == 0][['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']].std()
    mean_1 = df[df['target'] == 1][['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']].mean()
    std_1 = df[df['target'] == 1][['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']].std()

    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Calculate the z-score for each feature
        z_0 = (row[['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']] - mean_0) / std_0
        z_1 = (row[['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']] - mean_1) / std_1

        # Calculate the probability of the target being 0 or 1 using the z-score
        p_0 = np.exp(-0.5 * np.sum(z_0**2)) / (2 * np.pi * np.prod(std_0))
        p_1 = np.exp(-0.5 * np.sum(z_1**2)) / (2 * np.pi * np.prod(std_1))

        # Normalize the probabilities so they sum to 1
        p_sum = p_0 + p_1
        p_0 /= p_sum
        p_1 /= p_sum

        # Append the probability of the target being 1 to the output
        output.append(p_1)

    return np.array(output)
```

This code uses a Gaussian naive Bayes classifier to predict the probability of the target being 1. It assumes that the features are normally distributed and that they are independent given the target value. The code calculates the mean and standard deviation of each feature for each target value, and then uses these statistics to calculate the probability of the target being 0 or 1 for each row in the DataFrame. The probabilities are then normalized so they sum to 1. The code returns an array of the probabilities of the target being 1.
