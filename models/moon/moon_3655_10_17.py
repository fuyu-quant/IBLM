Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic linear regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logic of linear regression from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Define the data
data = {
    'Feature_1': [0.059, 0.203, -0.016, -0.858, 1.634, -0.52, 1.909, 1.05, 0.121, 0.91],
    'Feature_2': [0.2, 0.944, 0.375, 0.617, -0.302, 0.975, 0.038, 0.149, 0.163, 0.419],
    'target': [1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]
}

# Convert the data into a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate the coefficients of the linear regression model
X = df[['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']].values
y = df['target'].values
X = np.concatenate((np.ones((X.shape[0], 1)), X), axis=1)
beta = np.linalg.inv(X.T @ X) @ X.T @ y

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Calculate the predicted probability using the linear regression model
        y = beta[0] + beta[1]*row['Feature_1'] + beta[2]*row['Feature_2']
        # Apply the logistic function to convert the output into a probability
        y = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-y))
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first calculates the coefficients of the linear regression model using the given data. Then, in the `predict` function, it calculates the predicted probability for each row in the input DataFrame by applying the linear regression model and the logistic function to the features of the row. The logistic function is used to convert the output of the linear regression model into a probability between 0 and 1.
