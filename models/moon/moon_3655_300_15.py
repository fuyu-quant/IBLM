Here is a simple Python code that uses a linear regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code assumes that the input 'x' is a pandas DataFrame with columns 'Feature_1' and 'Feature_2'.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.

        # Simple linear regression model
        y = 0.5 * row['Feature_1'] + 0.5 * row['Feature_2']

        # Convert the output to a probability using the sigmoid function
        y = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-y))

        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first calculates a linear combination of the features 'Feature_1' and 'Feature_2' for each row in the DataFrame. The weights of the features in this linear combination are both set to 0.5, but they could be adjusted to improve the accuracy of the predictions.

The output of the linear combination is then converted to a probability using the sigmoid function. The sigmoid function maps any real number to the range (0, 1), which makes it suitable for predicting probabilities.

Please note that this is a very simple model and may not provide accurate predictions for complex datasets. For more accurate predictions, you could consider using a more sophisticated model, such as logistic regression or a neural network.
