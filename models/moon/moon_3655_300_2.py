Here is a simple Python code that uses a linear regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code assumes that the input 'x' is a pandas DataFrame with columns 'Feature_1', 'Feature_2', and 'target'.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []

    # Calculate the mean and standard deviation of each feature for target 0 and 1
    mean_0 = df[df['target'] == 0][['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']].mean()
    std_0 = df[df['target'] == 0][['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']].std()
    mean_1 = df[df['target'] == 1][['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']].mean()
    std_1 = df[df['target'] == 1][['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']].std()

    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Calculate the z-score for each feature
        z_score_0 = (row[['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']] - mean_0) / std_0
        z_score_1 = (row[['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']] - mean_1) / std_1

        # Calculate the probability of the target being 0 or 1 using the Gaussian distribution
        prob_0 = np.exp(-z_score_0**2 / 2) / (np.sqrt(2 * np.pi) * std_0)
        prob_1 = np.exp(-z_score_1**2 / 2) / (np.sqrt(2 * np.pi) * std_1)

        # The predicted probability of the target being 1 is the ratio of prob_1 to the sum of prob_0 and prob_1
        y = prob_1 / (prob_0 + prob_1)

        output.append(y['Feature_1'] * y['Feature_2'])

    return np.array(output)
```

This code first calculates the mean and standard deviation of each feature for target 0 and 1. Then, for each row in the DataFrame, it calculates the z-score for each feature, which is the number of standard deviations a data point is from the mean. The z-score is used to calculate the probability of the target being 0 or 1 using the Gaussian distribution. The predicted probability of the target being 1 is the ratio of the probability of the target being 1 to the sum of the probabilities of the target being 0 and 1. The final output is the product of the predicted probabilities for 'Feature_1' and 'Feature_2'.
