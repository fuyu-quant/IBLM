Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.4 * row['Feature_1'] + 0.6 * row['Feature_2']
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a sigmoid function, which is used in the logistic regression model to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1]. This is useful for transforming the linear regression output into a probability.

The `predict` function then applies this logistic regression model to each row of the input DataFrame. The coefficients of the model (0.4 and 0.6 in this case) are arbitrary and should be adjusted based on the specific problem and data.

Please note that this is a very basic implementation and may not provide accurate predictions for complex datasets. For more accurate predictions, you should consider using a more advanced machine learning model and/or feature engineering techniques.
