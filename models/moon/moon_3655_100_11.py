Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        z = 0.01 * row['Feature_1'] + 0.01 * row['Feature_2']  # linear combination of features
        y = sigmoid(z)  # apply sigmoid function to get probability
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a helper function `sigmoid` that implements the sigmoid function, which is used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1], which can be interpreted as probabilities.

The `predict` function then applies this logistic regression model to each row of the input DataFrame `x`. The model is very simple and just takes a linear combination of the two features 'Feature_1' and 'Feature_2', with a weight of 0.01 for each. This linear combination is then passed through the sigmoid function to get a probability.

Please note that this is a very basic model and its performance may not be very good. The weights of 0.01 for each feature were chosen arbitrarily and are not based on any analysis of the data. In a real-world scenario, you would want to use a more sophisticated model and properly train it on your data.
