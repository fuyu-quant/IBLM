Here is a simple Python code that uses a linear regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code assumes that the input 'x' is a pandas DataFrame with columns 'Feature_1', 'Feature_2', and 'target'.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []

    # Calculate the mean and standard deviation of each feature for each target value
    means = df.groupby('target').mean()
    stds = df.groupby('target').std()

    # Calculate the probability of each target value
    prob_0 = len(df[df['target'] == 0]) / len(df)
    prob_1 = 1 - prob_0

    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Calculate the probability of the data point under the assumption that the target is 0
        prob_feature_1_given_0 = np.exp(-(row['Feature_1'] - means.loc[0, 'Feature_1'])**2 / (2 * stds.loc[0, 'Feature_1']**2)) / (np.sqrt(2 * np.pi) * stds.loc[0, 'Feature_1'])
        prob_feature_2_given_0 = np.exp(-(row['Feature_2'] - means.loc[0, 'Feature_2'])**2 / (2 * stds.loc[0, 'Feature_2']**2)) / (np.sqrt(2 * np.pi) * stds.loc[0, 'Feature_2'])
        prob_data_given_0 = prob_feature_1_given_0 * prob_feature_2_given_0

        # Calculate the probability of the data point under the assumption that the target is 1
        prob_feature_1_given_1 = np.exp(-(row['Feature_1'] - means.loc[1, 'Feature_1'])**2 / (2 * stds.loc[1, 'Feature_1']**2)) / (np.sqrt(2 * np.pi) * stds.loc[1, 'Feature_1'])
        prob_feature_2_given_1 = np.exp(-(row['Feature_2'] - means.loc[1, 'Feature_2'])**2 / (2 * stds.loc[1, 'Feature_2']**2)) / (np.sqrt(2 * np.pi) * stds.loc[1, 'Feature_2'])
        prob_data_given_1 = prob_feature_1_given_1 * prob_feature_2_given_1

        # Use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the target being 1 given the data
        y = (prob_data_given_1 * prob_1) / (prob_data_given_1 * prob_1 + prob_data_given_0 * prob_0)
        output.append(y)

    return np.array(output)
```

This code uses the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm, which assumes that the data for each feature is normally distributed. It calculates the probability of the data given each possible target value, and then uses Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of each target value given the data. The output is an array of probabilities that the target is 1.
