Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any machine learning libraries, but instead implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.4 * row['Feature_1'] - 0.6 * row['Feature_2'] + 0.5
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a helper function `sigmoid` that implements the sigmoid function, which is used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1]. This function is then used in the `predict` function to compute the predicted probability that the "target" is 1 for each row in the input DataFrame.

The logistic regression model used in this code is a simple linear model with weights 0.4 and -0.6 for 'Feature_1' and 'Feature_2', respectively, and a bias term of 0.5. These weights and the bias term are arbitrary and should be adjusted based on the actual data to improve the accuracy of the predictions.

Please note that this is a very basic implementation and may not provide accurate predictions for complex datasets. For more accurate predictions, you should consider using a more sophisticated machine learning model and/or feature engineering techniques.
