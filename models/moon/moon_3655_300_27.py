Here is a simple Python code that uses a linear regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code assumes that the input 'x' is a pandas DataFrame with columns 'Feature_1' and 'Feature_2'.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.

        # Simple linear regression model
        y = 0.5 * row['Feature_1'] + 0.5 * row['Feature_2']

        # Convert the output to a probability between 0 and 1
        y = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-y))

        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code uses a simple linear regression model to predict the target value based on the features. The weights of the features are both set to 0.5, but these can be adjusted based on the specific problem and data. The output of the linear regression model is then converted to a probability between 0 and 1 using the logistic function. This is a common method for converting a real-valued output to a probability.

Please note that this is a very simple model and may not provide accurate predictions for complex data. For more accurate predictions, a more complex model such as a neural network or a decision tree may be needed.
