Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.4 * row['Feature_1'] + 0.6 * row['Feature_2'] - 0.5
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a helper function `sigmoid(x)` that implements the sigmoid function, which is used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1]. This function is then used in the `predict(x)` function to compute the predicted probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1.

The logistic regression model is defined in the line `z = 0.4 * row['Feature_1'] + 0.6 * row['Feature_2'] - 0.5`. The coefficients 0.4 and 0.6 are the weights of the features 'Feature_1' and 'Feature_2', respectively, and -0.5 is the bias term. These values are arbitrary and should be learned from the data for a real-world application.

The predicted probability `y` is then computed by applying the sigmoid function to `z`. The resulting value is a number in the range [0, 1], which can be interpreted as the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1.

Finally, the predicted probabilities are returned as a numpy array.
