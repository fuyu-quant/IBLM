Here is a simple Python code that uses a linear regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code assumes that the input 'x' is a pandas DataFrame with columns 'Feature_1', 'Feature_2', and 'target'.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []

    # Calculate the mean and standard deviation of each feature for each target value
    means = df.groupby('target').mean()
    stds = df.groupby('target').std()

    # Calculate the probability of each target value
    prob_target = df['target'].value_counts(normalize=True)

    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Calculate the probability of the features given each target value
        prob_feature_given_target = [
            np.exp(-((row[['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']] - means.loc[i]) ** 2) / (2 * stds.loc[i] ** 2)).prod()
            for i in [0, 1]
        ]

        # Calculate the probability of each target value given the features
        prob_target_given_feature = [
            prob_feature_given_target[i] * prob_target[i]
            for i in [0, 1]
        ]

        # Normalize the probabilities
        prob_target_given_feature = prob_target_given_feature / np.sum(prob_target_given_feature)

        # The probability that the target is 1
        y = prob_target_given_feature[1]

        output.append(y)

    return np.array(output)
```

This code uses the Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the target being 1 given the features. It assumes that the features are normally distributed for each target value. The mean and standard deviation of the features for each target value are calculated from the data. The prior probabilities of the target values are calculated from the data as well. The probabilities are then normalized so that they sum up to 1.
