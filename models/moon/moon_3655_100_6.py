Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        z = 0.01 * row['Feature_1'] + 0.01 * row['Feature_2']  # Linear combination of features
        y = sigmoid(z)  # Apply sigmoid function to get probability
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a helper function `sigmoid(x)` that implements the sigmoid function, which is used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1], making it possible to interpret the output as a probability.

The `predict(x)` function then applies this logistic regression model to each row of the input DataFrame `x`. It computes a linear combination of the features 'Feature_1' and 'Feature_2' (with weights 0.01 for simplicity), applies the sigmoid function to this linear combination to get a probability, and appends this probability to the output list.

Please note that this is a very basic model and its predictions may not be very accurate. In a real-world scenario, you would typically use a more sophisticated model and train it on your data to learn the best weights for the features.
