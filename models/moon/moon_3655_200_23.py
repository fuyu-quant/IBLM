Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning libraries, but instead implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the weights for the features
        w1 = 0.5
        w2 = 0.5
        
        # Calculate the weighted sum of the features
        z = w1*row['Feature_1'] + w2*row['Feature_2']
        
        # Apply the sigmoid function to the weighted sum to get the probability
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a sigmoid function, which is used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1], which can be interpreted as probabilities. The `predict` function then iterates over each row in the input DataFrame, calculates a weighted sum of the features using some predefined weights (in this case, both weights are set to 0.5), and applies the sigmoid function to this sum to get the predicted probability of the target being 1.

Please note that this is a very basic implementation and the weights are arbitrarily chosen. In a real-world scenario, you would use a more sophisticated method to learn the optimal weights from the data, such as gradient descent.
