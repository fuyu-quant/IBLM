Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code does not use any machine learning libraries, but instead implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        # The weights (w1, w2) and bias (b) are parameters to be learned from the data
        # Here, they are set to arbitrary values for demonstration purposes
        w1, w2, b = 0.1, 0.2, 0.5
        z = w1*row['Feature_1'] + w2*row['Feature_2'] + b
        y = sigmoid(z)

        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a helper function `sigmoid` that implements the sigmoid function, which is used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1]. This is useful for creating probability outputs.

The `predict` function then applies the logistic regression model to each row of the input DataFrame. The model is defined by the equation `z = w1*Feature_1 + w2*Feature_2 + b`, where `w1` and `w2` are the weights of the features and `b` is the bias term. The sigmoid of `z` is then computed to get the predicted probability `y` of the target being 1.

Please note that the weights and bias in this code are set to arbitrary values for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, these parameters would be learned from the data using a learning algorithm.
