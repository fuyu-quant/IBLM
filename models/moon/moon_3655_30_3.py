Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.4 * row['Feature_1'] + 0.6 * row['Feature_2']
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a sigmoid function, which is used in the logistic regression model to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1]. This is useful for transforming the linear regression output into a probability that the target class equals one.

Then, in the predict function, it iterates over each row in the input DataFrame, applies the logistic regression model to the features of the row, and appends the predicted probability to the output list.

The logistic regression model is defined as `z = 0.4 * row['Feature_1'] + 0.6 * row['Feature_2']`. This is a simple linear combination of the features, where the weights (0.4 and 0.6) are chosen arbitrarily. In a real-world scenario, these weights would be learned from the data using a method such as gradient descent.

Finally, the sigmoid function is applied to the output of the linear combination to obtain the predicted probability that the target class equals one. This probability is then appended to the output list.

Please note that this is a very basic implementation and may not provide accurate predictions for complex datasets. For more accurate predictions, you would typically use a more sophisticated machine learning model and train it on your data.
