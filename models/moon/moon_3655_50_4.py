Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        z = 0.01 * row['Feature_1'] + 0.01 * row['Feature_2']  # linear combination of features
        y = sigmoid(z)  # apply sigmoid function to get probability
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a helper function `sigmoid` that implements the sigmoid function, which is used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1], which can be interpreted as probabilities.

The `predict` function then applies this logistic regression model to each row of the input DataFrame `x`. The model is a simple linear combination of the features 'Feature_1' and 'Feature_2', with weights 0.01 for both features. The weights are chosen arbitrarily and can be adjusted to improve the accuracy of the model.

The output of the model is then passed through the sigmoid function to get the predicted probability that the "target" of the row is 1. This probability is appended to the `output` list, which is finally converted to a NumPy array and returned.

Please note that this is a very basic model and its accuracy might not be very high. For a more accurate model, you might want to consider using a more sophisticated machine learning model, such as a neural network, and training it on your data.
