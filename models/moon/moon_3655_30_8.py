Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Define the sigmoid function
def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

# Define the logistic regression model
def logistic_regression(x, w, b):
    return sigmoid(np.dot(x, w) + b)

# Define the predict function
def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    # Initialize the weights and bias
    w = np.array([0.1, 0.1])
    b = 0.1
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Extract the features
        features = np.array([row['Feature_1'], row['Feature_2']])
        # Compute the probability
        y = logistic_regression(features, w, b)
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines the sigmoid function, which is used in the logistic regression model to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1]. Then, it defines the logistic regression model, which takes as input the features of the data and the weights and bias of the model, and outputs the probability that the "target" of the data is 1.

Finally, it defines the predict function, which takes as input a DataFrame containing the data to be predicted. This function initializes the weights and bias of the logistic regression model, and then iterates over the rows of the DataFrame. For each row, it extracts the features of the data, computes the probability that the "target" of the data is 1 using the logistic regression model, and appends this probability to the output list. The function returns the output list as a NumPy array.

Please note that this code is a very basic implementation of the logistic regression model, and it does not include any training or optimization of the weights and bias. Therefore, the accuracy of the predictions may not be very high. For a more accurate prediction, you would need to train the logistic regression model on a training dataset, and then use the trained model to make predictions on the test dataset.
