Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(z):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        z = 0.4 * row['Feature_1'] - 0.6 * row['Feature_2'] + 0.5
        y = sigmoid(z)
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

In this code, the `sigmoid` function is used to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1], which can be interpreted as probabilities. The `predict` function applies this sigmoid function to a linear combination of the features 'Feature_1' and 'Feature_2'. The coefficients of the linear combination (0.4 and -0.6) and the intercept (0.5) are chosen arbitrarily and should be adjusted based on the actual data to improve the accuracy of the predictions.
