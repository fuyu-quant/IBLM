Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.5 * row['Feature_1'] + 0.5 * row['Feature_2']
        
        # Apply the sigmoid function to get the probability
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a sigmoid function, which is used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1]. This is useful for transforming the output of the logistic regression model into a probability.

The `predict` function then applies this logistic regression model to each row of the input DataFrame. The model is defined as a linear combination of the 'Feature_1' and 'Feature_2' columns, with equal weights of 0.5 for each feature. The sigmoid function is then applied to this linear combination to get the probability that the "target" is 1.

Please note that this is a very basic model and may not provide accurate predictions for complex datasets. For more accurate predictions, you may need to use a more sophisticated machine learning model, such as a neural network or a support vector machine.
