Here is a simple Python code that uses a linear regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code assumes that the input 'x' is a pandas DataFrame with columns 'Feature_1' and 'Feature_2'.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.

        # Simple linear regression model
        y = 0.5 * row['Feature_1'] + 0.5 * row['Feature_2']

        # Convert the output to a probability using the sigmoid function
        y = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-y))

        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first calculates a linear combination of the features 'Feature_1' and 'Feature_2' for each row in the DataFrame. The weights for the features are both set to 0.5, but these could be adjusted based on the specific problem and data.

The output of the linear regression model is then converted to a probability using the sigmoid function. The sigmoid function maps any real-valued number to the range (0, 1), which makes it suitable for interpreting the output as a probability.

Finally, the predicted probabilities are returned as a numpy array.
