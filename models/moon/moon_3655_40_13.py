Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.5 * row['Feature_1'] + 0.5 * row['Feature_2']
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a sigmoid function, which is used in the logistic regression model to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1]. This is useful for transforming the linear regression output into a probability.

The `predict` function then applies this logistic regression model to each row of the input DataFrame. The model is defined as `z = 0.5 * row['Feature_1'] + 0.5 * row['Feature_2']`, where `0.5` are the weights of the model. These weights are usually learned from the data, but in this case, they are set to `0.5` for simplicity. The output of the model is then transformed into a probability using the sigmoid function.

Finally, the function returns an array of the predicted probabilities.
