Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code does not use any machine learning libraries, but instead implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        z = 0.4 * row['Feature_1'] - 0.6 * row['Feature_2'] + 0.5
        y = sigmoid(z)
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a helper function `sigmoid` which is used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1], which can be interpreted as probabilities. The `predict` function then applies this logistic regression model to each row of the input DataFrame `x`. The coefficients (0.4, -0.6) and the intercept (0.5) in the model are chosen arbitrarily and should be learned from the data for a real-world application.

Please note that this is a very basic and naive implementation of logistic regression. For a real-world application, you should use a machine learning library like scikit-learn, which provides a more robust and efficient implementation of logistic regression with many more features.
