Here is a simple Python code that uses a linear regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code assumes that the input 'x' is a pandas DataFrame with columns 'Feature_1' and 'Feature_2'.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.

        # Linear regression model
        y = 0.5 * row['Feature_1'] + 0.5 * row['Feature_2']

        # Convert the output to a probability using the sigmoid function
        y = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-y))

        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first calculates a linear combination of the features 'Feature_1' and 'Feature_2' with equal weights of 0.5. Then it converts this value to a probability using the sigmoid function, which is commonly used for this purpose in logistic regression. The sigmoid function maps any real-valued number to the range (0, 1), which makes it suitable for interpreting the output as a probability.

Please note that this is a very simple model and may not provide accurate predictions if the relationship between the features and the target is not linear or if the features are not equally important. For a more accurate model, you would need to use a more sophisticated machine learning algorithm and possibly also perform feature engineering to create new features or transform the existing ones.
