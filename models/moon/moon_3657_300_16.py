Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.4 * row['Feature_1'] - 0.6 * row['Feature_2'] + 0.5
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a sigmoid function, which is used in the logistic regression model to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1]. This is useful for transforming the linear regression output into a probability.

The `predict` function then applies the logistic regression model to each row of the input DataFrame. The model parameters (0.4, -0.6, and 0.5) are chosen arbitrarily for this example, and in a real-world scenario, they would be learned from the data.

The output of the logistic regression model is a probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This probability is appended to the `output` list, which is then converted into a NumPy array and returned by the function.
