Here is a simple Python code that uses a linear regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code assumes that the input 'x' is a pandas DataFrame with columns 'Feature_1', 'Feature_2', and 'target'.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []

    # Calculate the mean and standard deviation of each feature for each target value
    means = df.groupby('target').mean()
    stds = df.groupby('target').std()

    # Calculate the prior probabilities of each target value
    priors = df['target'].value_counts() / len(df)

    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Calculate the likelihood of the data given each target value
        likelihoods = []
        for target in [0, 1]:
            likelihood = 1
            for feature in ['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']:
                mean = means.loc[target, feature]
                std = stds.loc[target, feature]
                value = row[feature]
                # Use the Gaussian distribution to calculate the likelihood
                likelihood *= np.exp(-(value-mean)**2 / (2*std**2)) / (np.sqrt(2*np.pi) * std)
            likelihoods.append(likelihood)

        # Calculate the posterior probabilities of each target value
        posteriors = []
        for target in [0, 1]:
            posterior = likelihoods[target] * priors[target]
            posteriors.append(posterior)

        # Normalize the posterior probabilities so they sum to 1
        posteriors = np.array(posteriors)
        posteriors /= np.sum(posteriors)

        # The predicted probability of the target being 1 is the second posterior probability
        y = posteriors[1]
        output.append(y)

    return np.array(output)
```

This code uses the Naive Bayes classifier, which is a simple yet powerful machine learning model. It assumes that the features are independent given the target value, and calculates the probability of each target value given the data using Bayes' theorem. The predicted probability of the target being 1 is the posterior probability of the target being 1 given the data.
