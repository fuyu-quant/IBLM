Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.4 * row['Feature_1'] - 0.6 * row['Feature_2'] + 0.5
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a sigmoid function, which is used in the logistic regression model to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1]. This is useful for transforming the linear regression output to a probability that the target class equals one.

In the predict function, we iterate over each row in the dataframe. For each row, we calculate the linear combination of the features 'Feature_1' and 'Feature_2' with some weights (0.4 and -0.6 in this case), and add a bias term (0.5 in this case). This is the basic form of a linear regression model. We then pass this linear combination through the sigmoid function to get the predicted probability that the target class equals one.

Please note that the weights and bias in this code are arbitrary and for illustrative purposes only. In a real-world scenario, these parameters would be learned from the data using a method such as gradient descent.
