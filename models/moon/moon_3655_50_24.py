Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.4 * row['Feature_1'] + 0.6 * row['Feature_2']
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a sigmoid function, which is used in the logistic regression model to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1]. This is useful for transforming the linear regression output to a probability that the target class equals one.

In the predict function, we iterate over each row in the dataframe. For each row, we calculate a weighted sum of the features (Feature_1 and Feature_2) using some weights (0.4 and 0.6 in this case). This weighted sum (z) is then passed through the sigmoid function to get the predicted probability (y) that the target class equals one.

Please note that the weights (0.4 and 0.6) used in this code are arbitrary and for demonstration purposes only. In a real-world scenario, these weights would be learned from the data using a learning algorithm.
