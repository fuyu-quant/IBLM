Here is a simple Python code that uses a logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        z = 0.4 * row['Feature_1'] - 0.6 * row['Feature_2'] + 0.5
        y = sigmoid(z)
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a helper function `sigmoid` that implements the sigmoid function, which is used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1]. This function is then used in the `predict` function to compute the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1.

The `predict` function takes as input a DataFrame `x` and returns a numpy array of probabilities. For each row in the DataFrame, it computes a linear combination of the features 'Feature_1' and 'Feature_2' with some weights (0.4 and -0.6, respectively), adds a bias term (0.5), and passes the result through the sigmoid function to obtain a probability. The weights and the bias term are chosen arbitrarily and should be learned from the data for a real-world application.

Please note that this is a very simplistic model and may not give accurate predictions for complex datasets. For a more accurate model, you would typically use a machine learning library like scikit-learn or TensorFlow to train a logistic regression model (or another appropriate model) on your data.
