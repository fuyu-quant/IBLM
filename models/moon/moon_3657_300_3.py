Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.4 * row['Feature_1'] - 0.6 * row['Feature_2'] + 0.5
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a sigmoid function, which is used in the logistic regression model to map any real-valued number into another value between 0 and 1. In the logistic regression model, this value represents the probability that the input point belongs to a certain class.

Then, in the `predict` function, it iterates over each row in the input DataFrame `x`, calculates the value `z` using the logistic regression model with some arbitrary weights (0.4 and -0.6) and bias (0.5), and applies the sigmoid function to `z` to get the predicted probability `y` that the "target" of the current data point is 1. The predicted probabilities are collected in the list `output`, which is then converted into a NumPy array and returned.

Please note that the weights and bias in the logistic regression model are set arbitrarily in this code. In a real-world scenario, these parameters should be learned from the training data using a learning algorithm such as gradient descent.
