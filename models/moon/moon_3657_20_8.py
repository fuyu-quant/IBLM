Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.4 * row['Feature_1'] - 0.6 * row['Feature_2'] + 0.5
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a sigmoid function, which is used in the logistic regression model to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1], which can then be interpreted as a probability. The `predict` function then applies this model to each row of the input DataFrame, using the 'Feature_1' and 'Feature_2' columns as inputs. The coefficients of the model (0.4 and -0.6) and the intercept (0.5) are chosen arbitrarily for this example, and would normally be learned from the data.

Please note that this is a very basic implementation and may not provide accurate predictions for complex datasets. For real-world applications, it is recommended to use a more sophisticated machine learning model, such as those provided by the scikit-learn library.
