Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.5 * row['Feature_1'] + 0.5 * row['Feature_2']
        y = sigmoid(z)

        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a sigmoid function, which is used in the logistic regression model to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1]. This is useful for transforming the linear regression output to a probability that can be used for classification.

In the predict function, we iterate over each row in the dataframe. For each row, we compute a linear combination of the features 'Feature_1' and 'Feature_2', using 0.5 as the weight for each feature. This is a simple way to combine the features, but in a real-world scenario, you would likely want to learn these weights from the data.

We then pass this linear combination through the sigmoid function to get a probability. This probability is then appended to the output list. At the end of the function, we convert the output list to a numpy array and return it.

Please note that this is a very basic implementation and may not give very accurate results. For a more accurate model, you would likely want to use a more sophisticated machine learning model and learn the weights from the data.
