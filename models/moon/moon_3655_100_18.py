Here is a simple Python code that uses a linear regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code assumes that the input 'x' is a pandas DataFrame with columns 'Feature_1', 'Feature_2', and 'target'.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []

    # Calculate the mean and standard deviation of each feature for each target value
    means = df.groupby('target').mean()
    stds = df.groupby('target').std()

    # Calculate the probability of each row belonging to target 1
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Calculate the z-score for each feature
        z1 = (row['Feature_1'] - means.loc[1, 'Feature_1']) / stds.loc[1, 'Feature_1']
        z2 = (row['Feature_2'] - means.loc[1, 'Feature_2']) / stds.loc[1, 'Feature_2']

        # Calculate the probability of the row belonging to target 1
        p1 = np.exp(-0.5 * (z1**2 + z2**2)) / (2 * np.pi * stds.loc[1, 'Feature_1'] * stds.loc[1, 'Feature_2'])

        # Append the probability to the output list
        output.append(p1)

    return np.array(output)
```

This code calculates the z-score for each feature in each row, which is a measure of how many standard deviations the feature value is from the mean value for that feature when the target is 1. It then calculates the probability of the row belonging to target 1 using the formula for the probability density function of a multivariate normal distribution. The output is an array of these probabilities.

Please note that this is a very simple model and may not provide accurate predictions for more complex datasets. For more accurate predictions, you may want to consider using a more sophisticated machine learning model, such as logistic regression or a neural network.
