Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        z = 0.01 * row['Feature_1'] + 0.01 * row['Feature_2']  # linear combination of features
        y = sigmoid(z)  # apply sigmoid function to get probability
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a helper function `sigmoid` that implements the sigmoid function, which is used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1], which can be interpreted as probabilities.

The `predict` function then applies this logistic regression model to each row of the input DataFrame `x`. The model is a simple linear combination of the features 'Feature_1' and 'Feature_2', with weights 0.01 for both features. The weights are chosen arbitrarily and can be adjusted to improve the accuracy of the model. The linear combination is then passed through the sigmoid function to get the predicted probability that the "target" is 1.

Please note that this is a very basic model and may not provide accurate predictions. For more accurate predictions, you would typically use a more sophisticated model and train it on your data using a machine learning library such as scikit-learn.
