Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.4 * row['Feature_1'] + 0.6 * row['Feature_2'] - 0.2
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

In this code, the logistic regression model is defined by the equation `z = 0.4 * Feature_1 + 0.6 * Feature_2 - 0.2`. The coefficients (0.4 and 0.6) and the intercept (-0.2) are arbitrary and should be adjusted based on the actual data to improve the accuracy of the prediction. The sigmoid function is used to convert the output of the logistic regression model to a probability between 0 and 1.

Please note that this is a very basic implementation and may not provide accurate predictions for complex datasets. For more accurate predictions, it is recommended to use a more sophisticated machine learning model and adjust the model parameters based on the actual data.
