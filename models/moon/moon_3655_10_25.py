Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Define the sigmoid function
def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

# Define the logistic regression model
def logistic_regression(x, w):
    return sigmoid(np.dot(x, w))

# Define the predict function
def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    # Initialize the weights
    w = np.array([0.1, 0.1])
    # Iterate over the rows of the dataframe
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Extract the features
        features = np.array([row['Feature_1'], row['Feature_2']])
        # Compute the prediction
        y = logistic_regression(features, w)
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)

# Define the dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Feature_1': [0.059, 0.203, -0.016, -0.858, 1.634, -0.52, 1.909, 1.05, 0.121, 0.91],
    'Feature_2': [0.2, 0.944, 0.375, 0.617, -0.302, 0.975, 0.038, 0.149, 0.163, 0.419],
    'target': [1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]
})

# Use the predict function
predictions = predict(df)
print(predictions)
```

Please note that this code is a very basic implementation of logistic regression and does not include any form of optimization for the weights (like gradient descent), feature scaling, or handling of categorical variables. For a more robust implementation, you might want to consider using a machine learning library like scikit-learn.
