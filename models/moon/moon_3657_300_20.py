Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.4 * row['Feature_1'] - 0.6 * row['Feature_2'] + 0.5
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a helper function `sigmoid` that implements the sigmoid function, which is used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1]. This function is then used in the `predict` function to compute the predicted probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1.

The logistic regression model is defined in the `predict` function. The model uses the features 'Feature_1' and 'Feature_2' of the data, and the coefficients 0.4 and -0.6 are chosen arbitrarily. The intercept of the model is set to 0.5. The model computes a linear combination of the features and the intercept, and then applies the sigmoid function to this combination to obtain the predicted probability.

The `predict` function iterates over the rows of the data, computes the predicted probability for each row, and appends the probability to the output list. Finally, the function returns the output list as a numpy array.
