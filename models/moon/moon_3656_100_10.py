Here is a simple Python code that uses a logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code assumes that the input data is a pandas DataFrame with columns named 'Feature_1', 'Feature_2', and 'target'.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Prepare the data
data = [
    [1.342,-0.412,1.0], [2.029,0.302,1.0], [0.532,-0.396,1.0], [0.021,0.333,1.0], [1.731,-0.241,1.0],
    [0.753,-0.613,1.0], [1.957,0.304,1.0], [1.209,-0.53,1.0], [1.689,-0.229,1.0], [0.06,0.525,1.0],
    # ... add the rest of your data here ...
]
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['Feature_1', 'Feature_2', 'target'])

# Split the data into features and target
X = df[['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']]
y = df['target']

# Train a logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        features = row[['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']].values.reshape(1, -1)
        prob = model.predict_proba(features)[0][1]
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(prob)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first prepares the data and splits it into features (X) and target (y). Then it trains a logistic regression model using this data. The `predict` function takes a DataFrame as input, iterates over its rows, and for each row, it reshapes the features into a 2D array and uses the trained model to predict the probability that the target is 1. The predicted probabilities are collected in a list and returned as a numpy array.
