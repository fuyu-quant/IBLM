Here is a simple Python code that uses a linear regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code assumes that the input 'x' is a pandas DataFrame with columns 'Feature_1', 'Feature_2', and 'target'.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []

    # Calculate the mean and standard deviation of each feature for each target class
    means = df.groupby('target').mean()
    stds = df.groupby('target').std()

    # Calculate the prior probabilities of each target class
    priors = df['target'].value_counts() / len(df)

    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Calculate the likelihood of the data given each target class
        likelihood0 = np.prod(np.exp(-(row[['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']] - means.loc[0])**2 / (2 * stds.loc[0]**2)) / np.sqrt(2 * np.pi * stds.loc[0]**2))
        likelihood1 = np.prod(np.exp(-(row[['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']] - means.loc[1])**2 / (2 * stds.loc[1]**2)) / np.sqrt(2 * np.pi * stds.loc[1]**2))

        # Calculate the posterior probabilities of each target class
        posterior0 = likelihood0 * priors[0]
        posterior1 = likelihood1 * priors[1]

        # Normalize the posterior probabilities to get the final prediction
        y = posterior1 / (posterior0 + posterior1)
        output.append(y)

    return np.array(output)
```

This code uses a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier to predict the probability of the target being 1. It assumes that the features are normally distributed and that they are conditionally independent given the target class. The prediction is made by calculating the posterior probability of each target class given the data, and then normalizing these probabilities to sum to 1.
