Here is a simple Python code that uses a linear regression model to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code assumes that the input 'x' is a pandas DataFrame with columns 'Feature_1', 'Feature_2', and 'target'.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []

    # Calculate the mean and standard deviation of each feature for target 0 and 1
    mean_0 = df[df['target'] == 0][['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']].mean()
    std_0 = df[df['target'] == 0][['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']].std()
    mean_1 = df[df['target'] == 1][['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']].mean()
    std_1 = df[df['target'] == 1][['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']].std()

    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Calculate the probability of the data point under the assumption of target 0 and 1
        prob_0 = np.exp(-((row[['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']] - mean_0) ** 2 / (2 * std_0 ** 2)).sum())
        prob_1 = np.exp(-((row[['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']] - mean_1) ** 2 / (2 * std_1 ** 2)).sum())

        # Normalize the probabilities so that they sum to 1
        y = prob_1 / (prob_0 + prob_1)
        output.append(y)

    return np.array(output)
```

This code uses a Gaussian naive Bayes classifier to predict the probability of the target being 1. It assumes that the features are normally distributed and that they are independent given the target. The mean and standard deviation of each feature are calculated separately for target 0 and 1. Then, for each data point, the code calculates the probability of the data point under the assumption of target 0 and 1, and normalizes these probabilities so that they sum to 1. The output is the probability of the target being 1.
