Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(z):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        z = 0.5 * row['Feature_1'] + 0.5 * row['Feature_2']
        y = sigmoid(z)
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a helper function `sigmoid(z)` that implements the sigmoid function, which is used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1]. This function is then used in the `predict(x)` function to compute the predicted probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1.

In the `predict(x)` function, we first make a copy of the input DataFrame `x` to avoid modifying the original data. We then iterate over each row of the DataFrame, compute a linear combination of the features 'Feature_1' and 'Feature_2' (with weights 0.5 and 0.5, respectively), and pass this value through the sigmoid function to obtain the predicted probability. This probability is then appended to the output list, which is finally converted to a NumPy array and returned.

Please note that this is a very basic model and its performance may not be optimal. The weights of the features (0.5 and 0.5 in this case) should ideally be learned from the data using a learning algorithm, but this is beyond the scope of this task.
