Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        z = 0.01 * row['Feature_1'] + 0.01 * row['Feature_2']  # linear combination of features
        y = sigmoid(z)  # apply sigmoid function to get probability
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a helper function `sigmoid(x)` that implements the sigmoid function, which is used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1], which can be interpreted as probabilities.

The `predict(x)` function then applies this logistic regression model to each row of the input DataFrame `x`. It computes a linear combination of the features 'Feature_1' and 'Feature_2' with some weights (here, both weights are set to 0.01 for simplicity), and then applies the sigmoid function to this linear combination to get the predicted probability that the "target" is 1.

Please note that this is a very basic implementation of logistic regression, and the weights of the features are set arbitrarily. In a real-world scenario, you would want to train your logistic regression model on some training data to learn the optimal weights that minimize the prediction error.
