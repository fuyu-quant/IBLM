Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        z = 0.4 * row['Feature_1'] - 0.6 * row['Feature_2'] + 0.5
        y = sigmoid(z)
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

In this code, the `sigmoid` function is used to map any real-valued number into another value between 0 and 1. In machine learning, we use sigmoid to map predictions to probabilities.

The `predict` function applies the logistic regression model to each row of the input DataFrame. The coefficients (0.4 for `Feature_1`, -0.6 for `Feature_2`) and the intercept (0.5) of the logistic regression model are chosen arbitrarily for this example. In a real-world scenario, these parameters should be estimated from the data.

Please note that this is a very basic implementation and may not provide accurate predictions. For more accurate predictions, you should consider using a more sophisticated machine learning model and estimate the parameters from the data.
