Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        z = 0.1 * row['Feature_1'] + 0.2 * row['Feature_2']  # These weights (0.1 and 0.2) are arbitrary and should be learned from data
        y = sigmoid(z)
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a helper function `sigmoid` that implements the sigmoid function, which is used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1], which can be interpreted as probabilities.

The `predict` function then applies this logistic regression model to each row of the input DataFrame `x`. The model is defined by the line `z = 0.1 * row['Feature_1'] + 0.2 * row['Feature_2']`, where `0.1` and `0.2` are the weights of the model. These weights are arbitrary and should ideally be learned from the data. The sigmoid of `z` is then computed to get the predicted probability `y` that the "target" of the row is 1.

Please note that this is a very basic model and its performance may not be satisfactory. For better performance, you should consider using more sophisticated models and techniques, such as neural networks, gradient boosting, feature engineering, etc.
