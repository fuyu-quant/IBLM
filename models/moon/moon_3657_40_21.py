Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the coefficients for Feature_1 and Feature_2
        coef_1 = 0.5
        coef_2 = -0.5
        
        # Calculate the linear combination of the features
        z = coef_1 * row['Feature_1'] + coef_2 * row['Feature_2']
        
        # Apply the sigmoid function to get the probability
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a sigmoid function, which is used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1], which can be interpreted as probabilities. Then, in the predict function, it calculates a linear combination of the features for each row in the dataframe, applies the sigmoid function to this value to get the probability, and appends this probability to the output list.

Please note that the coefficients for Feature_1 and Feature_2 are set to 0.5 and -0.5 respectively for simplicity, but in a real-world scenario, these would be learned from the data using a method such as gradient descent.
