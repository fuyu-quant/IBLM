Here is a simple Python code that uses a logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code assumes that the data is stored in a pandas DataFrame.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Prepare the data
data = [
    [1.342,-0.412,1.0],
    [2.029,0.302,1.0],
    [0.532,-0.396,1.0],
    # ... add the rest of your data here ...
    [1.466,-0.368,1.0]
]
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['Feature_1', 'Feature_2', 'target'])

# Split the data into features and target
X = df[['Feature_1', 'Feature_2']]
y = df['target']

# Train a logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        y = model.predict_proba(row.values.reshape(1, -1))[0][1]
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first prepares the data and splits it into features (X) and target (y). Then, it trains a logistic regression model using the features and target. The `predict` function takes a DataFrame of unknown data, makes a copy of it, and then iterates over each row. For each row, it reshapes the row into a 2D array (since `predict_proba` expects a 2D array), and then uses the trained model to predict the probability that the target is 1. The predicted probability is then appended to the `output` list. Finally, the function returns the `output` list as a numpy array.
