Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code assumes that the input data is a pandas DataFrame.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    
    # Define the logistic regression model
    model = LogisticRegression()
    
    # Split the data into features and target
    features = df.drop('target', axis=1)
    target = df['target']
    
    # Fit the model to the data
    model.fit(features, target)
    
    # Predict the probabilities for each row in the data
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Reshape the row to 2D array as the model expects this shape
        row = row.values.reshape(1, -1)
        
        # Predict the probability of the target being 1
        y = model.predict_proba(row)[:, 1]
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a logistic regression model, then splits the data into features and target. It fits the model to the data, then predicts the probabilities for each row in the data. The predicted probabilities are then appended to the output list, which is returned as a numpy array.
