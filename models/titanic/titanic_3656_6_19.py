Here is a simple example of a prediction function that uses a basic rule-based approach. This function assumes that the target is more likely to be 1 if the passenger is female, is in first class, and embarked from Cherbourg. This is a very simplistic approach and would likely not perform well in a real-world scenario, but it serves to illustrate the basic structure of a prediction function.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0 and row['pclass'] == 1.0 and row['embarked_C'] == 1.0:
            y = 1.0
        else:
            y = 0.0
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This function could be used as follows:

```python
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
predictions = predict(data)
```

Please note that this function does not actually learn from the data, but simply applies a set of predefined rules. A more sophisticated approach would involve training a machine learning model on the data, which could then be used to make predictions.
