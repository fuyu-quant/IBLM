Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(z):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = np.dot(row, np.array([0.01]*32))  # Initialize weights to 0.01
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a helper function `sigmoid` which is used in the logistic regression model. The `predict` function then applies this model to each row of the input DataFrame `x`. The model is defined by the equation `y = sigmoid(np.dot(row, weights))`, where `weights` is a vector of model parameters. In this case, we initialize all weights to 0.01 for simplicity. The dot product `np.dot(row, weights)` computes the weighted sum of the input features, and the `sigmoid` function then transforms this sum into a probability between 0 and 1. The predicted probabilities are collected in the list `output`, which is finally converted to a NumPy array and returned.

Please note that this is a very basic implementation and the model's performance can be significantly improved by training the weights on the data, for example using gradient descent or another optimization algorithm.
