Here is a simple example of a prediction function that uses a basic rule-based approach. This function assumes that the target is more likely to be 1 if the passenger is female, is in first class, and embarked from Cherbourg. This is a very simplistic approach and would likely not perform well in a real-world scenario, but it serves to illustrate the basic structure of a prediction function.

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        p = 0.0
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0:
            p += 0.3
        if row['pclass'] == 1.0:
            p += 0.3
        if row['embark_town_Cherbourg'] == 1.0:
            p += 0.4
        y = min(p, 1.0)
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This function iterates over each row in the input DataFrame, calculates a probability based on the values in the 'sex_female', 'pclass', and 'embark_town_Cherbourg' columns, and then appends this probability to the output list. The final result is a numpy array of probabilities.
