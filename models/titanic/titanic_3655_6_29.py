Here is a simple example of a prediction function. This function uses a simple rule-based approach to predict the target. It assumes that if the passenger is female, the target is more likely to be 1, and if the passenger is male, the target is more likely to be 0. This is a very simplistic approach and would not be very accurate in a real-world scenario, but it serves as an example of how you might start to approach this problem.

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0:
            y = 0.75
        else:
            y = 0.25
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This function would return a high probability for female passengers and a low probability for male passengers. This is based on the assumption that female passengers were more likely to survive on the Titanic (which is the dataset this appears to be based on). However, this is a very simplistic model and would not be very accurate. A more sophisticated model would take into account more features and use a machine learning algorithm to make predictions.
