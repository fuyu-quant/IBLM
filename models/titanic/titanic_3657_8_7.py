Here is a simple example of a prediction function. This function uses a simple rule-based approach to predict the target. The rules are based on the mean values of the features for each target class. If the feature values of a sample are closer to the mean values of the features for the target class 1, the function predicts a high probability for the target class 1. If the feature values of a sample are closer to the mean values of the features for the target class 0, the function predicts a low probability for the target class 1.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []

    # Calculate the mean values of the features for each target class
    mean_values_0 = df[df['target'] == 0].mean()
    mean_values_1 = df[df['target'] == 1].mean()

    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Calculate the Euclidean distance between the feature values of the sample and the mean values of the features for each target class
        distance_to_0 = np.sqrt(np.sum((row - mean_values_0) ** 2))
        distance_to_1 = np.sqrt(np.sum((row - mean_values_1) ** 2))

        # If the distance to the mean values of the features for the target class 1 is smaller, predict a high probability for the target class 1
        if distance_to_1 < distance_to_0:
            y = 0.9
        # If the distance to the mean values of the features for the target class 0 is smaller, predict a low probability for the target class 1
        else:
            y = 0.1

        output.append(y)

    return np.array(output)
```

Please note that this is a very simple and naive approach to predict the target. In a real-world scenario, you would typically use a machine learning model to make predictions based on the data.
