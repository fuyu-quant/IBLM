Here is a simple example of a prediction function that uses a basic rule-based approach. This function assumes that the target is more likely to be 1 if the passenger is female, is in first class, and embarked from Cherbourg. This is a very simplistic approach and would likely not perform well in a real-world scenario, but it serves as an example of how you might begin to approach this problem without using a machine learning model.

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        p = 0.0
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0:
            p += 0.3
        if row['pclass'] == 1.0:
            p += 0.3
        if row['embarked_C'] == 1.0:
            p += 0.4
        y = min(p, 1.0)
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This function simply adds up probabilities based on the presence of certain features. If the passenger is female, it adds 0.3 to the probability. If the passenger is in first class, it adds another 0.3. If the passenger embarked from Cherbourg, it adds 0.4. The final probability is the sum of these values, capped at 1.0. 

Please note that the values 0.3 and 0.4 are arbitrary and chosen for the sake of this example. In a real-world scenario, you would want to use data analysis or machine learning to determine the best values to use.
