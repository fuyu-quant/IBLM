Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(z):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Initialize weights (beta coefficients) and bias (intercept)
        # These values should be learned from the data, but for simplicity, we initialize them to 0
        weights = np.zeros(df.shape[1] - 1)  # Exclude the target column
        bias = 0

        # Compute the linear combination of inputs and weights
        z = np.dot(row[:-1], weights) + bias  # Exclude the target value

        # Apply the sigmoid function
        y = sigmoid(z)

        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

Please note that this code is a very basic and naive implementation of logistic regression. In a real-world scenario, you would need to learn the weights and bias from the data, typically using a method such as gradient descent. This code does not do that, and therefore its predictions will not be accurate. For a more accurate model, you should use a machine learning library such as scikit-learn, which can learn these parameters from the data.
