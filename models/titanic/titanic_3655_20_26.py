Here is a simple example of a prediction function that uses a rule-based approach. This function assumes that if a passenger is female, they have a high probability of survival (target=1), and if they are male, they have a low probability of survival (target=0). This is based on historical data from the Titanic disaster, where women and children were given priority for lifeboat seats.

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        if row['sex_female'] == 1:
            y = 0.9  # High probability for females
        else:
            y = 0.1  # Low probability for males
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This is a very simple model and does not take into account other factors that could influence survival, such as age, class, or fare paid. A more complex model could be developed by adding more conditions and adjusting the probability values accordingly. However, for a more accurate model, it would be better to use a machine learning algorithm that can learn from the data and make predictions based on multiple factors.
