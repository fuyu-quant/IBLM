Here is a simple example of a prediction function that uses a basic rule-based approach. This function assumes that passengers who are female, young, and in first class have a higher probability of survival (target=1), while others have a lower probability. This is based on the historical fact that women, children, and first-class passengers were given priority during the evacuation of the Titanic.

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        if row['sex_female'] == 1 and row['age'] < 18 and row['pclass'] == 1:
            y = 0.9
        elif row['sex_female'] == 1 and row['age'] < 18:
            y = 0.8
        elif row['sex_female'] == 1 and row['pclass'] == 1:
            y = 0.7
        elif row['sex_female'] == 1:
            y = 0.6
        elif row['age'] < 18 and row['pclass'] == 1:
            y = 0.5
        elif row['age'] < 18:
            y = 0.4
        elif row['pclass'] == 1:
            y = 0.3
        else:
            y = 0.1
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This function is a very simple example and does not take into account all the features in the dataset. For a more accurate prediction, a machine learning model should be trained on the data.
