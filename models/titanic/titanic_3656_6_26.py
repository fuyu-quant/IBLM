Here is a simple example of a prediction function that uses a basic rule-based approach. This function assumes that if a passenger is female, in first class, and embarked from Cherbourg, they have a high probability of survival (target=1). Otherwise, they have a low probability of survival. This is a very simplistic approach and would not be very accurate in a real-world scenario, but it serves as an example of how you might begin to approach this problem without using a machine learning model.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0 and row['class_First'] == 1.0 and row['embark_town_Cherbourg'] == 1.0:
            y = 0.9  # High probability of survival
        else:
            y = 0.1  # Low probability of survival
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This function could be improved by incorporating more features into the decision-making process, or by using a more sophisticated method for determining the probability of survival. However, without using a machine learning model, it would be difficult to accurately predict the survival probability based on such a large number of features.
