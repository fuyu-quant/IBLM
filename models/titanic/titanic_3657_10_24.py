Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code assumes that the input data is a pandas DataFrame.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []

    # Define the logistic regression model
    model = LogisticRegression()

    # Split the data into features and target
    features = df.drop('target', axis=1)
    target = df['target']

    # Fit the model to the data
    model.fit(features, target)

    # Predict the probabilities for each row in the data
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Reshape the row to 2D array as the model expects input in this shape
        row = row.drop('target').values.reshape(1, -1)
        # Predict the probability for the row
        prob = model.predict_proba(row)
        # Append the probability of the target being 1 to the output list
        output.append(prob[0][1])

    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a logistic regression model, then splits the data into features and target. It fits the model to the data, and then for each row in the data, it predicts the probability that the target is 1 and appends this probability to the output list. Finally, it returns the output list as a numpy array.
