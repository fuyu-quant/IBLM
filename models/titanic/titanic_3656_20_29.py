Here is a simple example of a prediction function that uses a basic rule-based approach. This function assumes that passengers who are female, young, and in first class have a higher probability of survival. This is based on historical data from the Titanic disaster, where women, children, and first-class passengers were given priority for lifeboat seats.

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Initialize probability
        prob = 0.0

        # Increase probability if passenger is female
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0:
            prob += 0.3

        # Increase probability if passenger is young
        if row['age'] <= 18.0:
            prob += 0.3

        # Increase probability if passenger is in first class
        if row['pclass'] == 1.0:
            prob += 0.3

        # Normalize probability to [0,1] range
        prob = min(max(prob, 0.0), 1.0)

        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(prob)
    return np.array(output)
```

This function is a very simple example and does not take into account all possible factors that could influence survival. For a more accurate prediction, a machine learning model trained on a large dataset would be more appropriate.
