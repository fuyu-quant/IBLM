Here is a simple example of a prediction function. This function calculates the mean of each column for rows where the target is 1 and 0, respectively. Then, for each row in the input data, it calculates the Euclidean distance to the mean of each class. The output is the ratio of the distance to the class 0 mean over the sum of the distances to both class means. This will be a high value when the input is close to the class 1 mean and a low value when it is close to the class 0 mean.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy.spatial import distance

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    class_0_mean = df[df['target'] == 0].mean()
    class_1_mean = df[df['target'] == 1].mean()
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        dist_0 = distance.euclidean(row, class_0_mean)
        dist_1 = distance.euclidean(row, class_1_mean)
        y = dist_0 / (dist_0 + dist_1)
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

Please note that this is a very simple prediction function and may not give accurate results for complex datasets. For more accurate predictions, you should consider using a machine learning model.
