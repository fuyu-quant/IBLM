        # Here we are using a simple rule-based approach to predict the target.
        # We are assuming that the target is more likely to be 1 if the passenger is female, embarked from Cherbourg, is alone, and is in first class.
        # This is based on the historical data from the Titanic disaster, where women, children, and first-class passengers were more likely to survive.
        # We are also assuming that the target is more likely to be 0 if the passenger is male, embarked from Southampton, is not alone, and is in third class.
        # These assumptions may not be completely accurate, but they should provide a reasonable starting point for the prediction.
        # The actual prediction is a weighted sum of these factors, with weights chosen to reflect their perceived importance.
