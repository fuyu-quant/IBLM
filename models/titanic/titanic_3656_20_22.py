Here is a simple python code that predicts the probability of "target" being 1 based on the given data. This code uses a simple rule-based approach to predict the probability. The rules are based on the observation of the given data.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Rule 1: If 'pclass' is 1 or 2 and 'sex_female' is 1, then high probability of survival
        if (row['pclass'] <= 2) and (row['sex_female'] == 1):
            y = 0.9
        # Rule 2: If 'pclass' is 3 and 'sex_female' is 1, then medium probability of survival
        elif (row['pclass'] == 3) and (row['sex_female'] == 1):
            y = 0.6
        # Rule 3: If 'pclass' is 1 and 'sex_male' is 1 and 'age' is less than 18, then medium probability of survival
        elif (row['pclass'] == 1) and (row['sex_male'] == 1) and (row['age'] < 18):
            y = 0.6
        # Rule 4: If 'pclass' is 1 and 'sex_male' is 1 and 'age' is greater than or equal to 18, then low probability of survival
        elif (row['pclass'] == 1) and (row['sex_male'] == 1) and (row['age'] >= 18):
            y = 0.3
        # Rule 5: If 'pclass' is 2 or 3 and 'sex_male' is 1, then very low probability of survival
        elif (row['pclass'] >= 2) and (row['sex_male'] == 1):
            y = 0.1
        else:
            y = 0.5

        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

Please note that this is a very simple rule-based approach and may not give accurate results for all cases. For more accurate results, you should consider using machine learning models.
