Here is a simple example of a prediction function using a basic rule-based approach. This function assumes that the target is more likely to be 1 if the passenger is female, is in first class, and embarked from Cherbourg. This is a very simplistic approach and would not be very accurate in a real-world scenario, but it serves as an example of how you might begin to approach this problem without using a machine learning model.

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0 and row['pclass'] == 1.0 and row['embarked_C'] == 1.0:
            y = 1.0
        else:
            y = 0.0
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This function will return an array of 1s and 0s, where 1 indicates a high probability of the target being 1, and 0 indicates a low probability. The function uses a very basic rule to make this prediction: if the passenger is female, is in first class, and embarked from Cherbourg, then the function predicts a high probability of the target being 1. Otherwise, it predicts a low probability. This is a very simplistic approach and would not be very accurate in a real-world scenario, but it serves as an example of how you might begin to approach this problem without using a machine learning model.
