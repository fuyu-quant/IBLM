Here is a simple example of a prediction function that uses a basic rule-based approach. This function assumes that passengers who are female, embarked from Cherbourg, and are in first class have a higher probability of survival. This is based on historical data from the Titanic disaster, where women, children, and first-class passengers were given priority for lifeboat seats.

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0 and row['embarked_C'] == 1.0 and row['class_First'] == 1.0:
            y = 0.9
        else:
            y = 0.1
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This function will return a high probability (0.9) for passengers who are female, embarked from Cherbourg, and are in first class, and a low probability (0.1) for all other passengers. Please note that this is a very simplistic model and does not take into account many other factors that could influence survival. For a more accurate model, you would likely want to use a machine learning algorithm that can learn from the data and make more nuanced predictions.
