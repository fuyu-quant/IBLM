Here is a simple Python code that predicts the probability of "target" being 1 based on the given data. This code uses a simple rule-based approach to predict the probability. It checks if the passenger is female, if the passenger is alone, and if the passenger is in the first class. If all these conditions are met, it predicts a high probability of survival (0.9). Otherwise, it predicts a low probability of survival (0.1). 

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0 and row['alone_True'] == 1.0 and row['pclass'] == 1.0:
            y = 0.9
        else:
            y = 0.1
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

Please note that this is a very simple rule-based approach and may not provide accurate predictions for all cases. For more accurate predictions, you may need to use a machine learning model.
