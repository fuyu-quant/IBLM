Here is a simple example of a prediction function that uses a basic rule-based approach. This function assumes that the target is more likely to be 1 if the passenger is female, is in first class, and embarked from Cherbourg. This is a very simplistic approach and would likely not perform well in a real-world scenario, but it serves as an example of how you might begin to approach this problem without using a machine learning model.

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        p = 0.0
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0:
            p += 0.3
        if row['pclass'] == 1.0:
            p += 0.3
        if row['embarked_C'] == 1.0:
            p += 0.3
        if p > 1.0:
            p = 1.0
        y = p
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This function will return a probability value for each row in the input DataFrame. The probability is calculated as the sum of three factors, each of which contributes a maximum of 0.3 to the total probability. If the sum of these factors exceeds 1.0, the probability is capped at 1.0.
