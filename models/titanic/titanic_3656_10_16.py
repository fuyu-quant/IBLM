Here is a simple example of a prediction function. This function uses a simple rule-based approach to predict the target. It assumes that if the passenger is female, the target is more likely to be 1, and if the passenger is male, the target is more likely to be 0. This is a very simplistic approach and would not be very accurate in a real-world scenario, but it serves as an example of how you might structure your prediction function.

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0:
            y = 0.75
        else:
            y = 0.25
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This function iterates over each row in the dataframe, checks the value of the 'sex_female' column, and assigns a probability based on that value. If the passenger is female (i.e., 'sex_female' is 1.0), it assigns a high probability (0.75) to the target being 1. If the passenger is not female (i.e., 'sex_female' is 0.0), it assigns a low probability (0.25) to the target being 1. The function then returns an array of these probabilities.
