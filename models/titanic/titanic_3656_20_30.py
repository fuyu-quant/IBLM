Here is a simple example of a prediction function that uses a basic rule-based approach. This function assumes that passengers who are female, young, and in first class have a higher probability of survival. This is based on historical data from the Titanic disaster, where women, children, and first-class passengers were given priority for lifeboat seats.

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        y = 0.0
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0:
            y += 0.3
        if row['age'] <= 18.0:
            y += 0.3
        if row['pclass'] == 1.0:
            y += 0.3
        if y > 1.0:
            y = 1.0
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This function will return a probability value between 0 and 1 for each row in the input DataFrame. The probability is calculated based on three factors: whether the passenger is female, whether the passenger is 18 years old or younger, and whether the passenger is in first class. Each of these factors contributes 0.3 to the probability. If the total probability exceeds 1, it is capped at 1.

Please note that this is a very simple and naive approach to predicting survival on the Titanic. A more sophisticated approach would use machine learning to learn a model from the data, which could capture more complex relationships between the features and the target variable.
