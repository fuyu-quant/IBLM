Here is a simple python code that uses a basic rule-based approach to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code assumes that the target is more likely to be 1 if the passenger is female, is in the first class, and embarked from Cherbourg. This is a very basic approach and may not provide accurate results. For more accurate results, a machine learning model should be used.

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        y = 0
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0:
            y += 0.3
        if row['class_First'] == 1.0:
            y += 0.3
        if row['embark_town_Cherbourg'] == 1.0:
            y += 0.3
        if y > 1.0:
            y = 1.0
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code will return a probability value between 0 and 1 for each row in the input dataframe. The probability is calculated based on the values in the 'sex_female', 'class_First', and 'embark_town_Cherbourg' columns. If the passenger is female, the probability is increased by 0.3. If the passenger is in the first class, the probability is increased by 0.3. If the passenger embarked from Cherbourg, the probability is increased by 0.3. If the total probability exceeds 1, it is capped at 1.
