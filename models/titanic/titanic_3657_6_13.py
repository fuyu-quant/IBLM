Here is a simple example of a prediction function that uses a weighted sum of the features to predict the target. This is a very basic model and will likely not perform well on real-world data, but it serves as a starting point.

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # This is a simple weighted sum model. Weights are arbitrary and should be learned from data in a real-world scenario.
        y = 0.1*row['pclass'] + 0.2*row['age'] + 0.3*row['sibsp'] + 0.4*row['parch'] + 0.5*row['fare'] + 0.6*row['sex_female'] + 0.7*row['sex_male'] + 0.8*row['embarked_C'] + 0.9*row['embarked_Q'] + row['embarked_S'] + 1.1*row['alive_no'] + 1.2*row['alive_yes'] + 1.3*row['alone_False'] + 1.4*row['alone_True'] + 1.5*row['adult_male_False'] + 1.6*row['adult_male_True'] + 1.7*row['who_child'] + 1.8*row['who_man'] + 1.9*row['who_woman'] + 2.0*row['class_First'] + 2.1*row['class_Second'] + 2.2*row['class_Third'] + 2.3*row['deck_A'] + 2.4*row['deck_B'] + 2.5*row['deck_C'] + 2.6*row['deck_D'] + 2.7*row['deck_E'] + 2.8*row['deck_F'] + 2.9*row['deck_G'] + 3.0*row['embark_town_Cherbourg'] + 3.1*row['embark_town_Queenstown'] + 3.2*row['embark_town_Southampton']
        
        # Normalize the output to the range [0, 1] to represent a probability.
        y = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-y))
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This function uses a logistic function to normalize the output of the weighted sum to the range [0, 1], which can be interpreted as a probability. The weights in the weighted sum are arbitrary and should be learned from data in a real-world scenario.
