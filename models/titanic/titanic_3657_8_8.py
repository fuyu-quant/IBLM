Here is a simple Python code that predicts the probability of "target" being 1 based on the given data. This code uses a simple rule-based approach to make predictions. It checks if certain conditions are met in the data and assigns a probability based on these conditions. 

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Initialize probability to 0.5
        prob = 0.5

        # Increase probability if passenger is female
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0:
            prob += 0.1

        # Increase probability if passenger is in first class
        if row['pclass'] == 1.0:
            prob += 0.1

        # Decrease probability if passenger is alone
        if row['alone_True'] == 1.0:
            prob -= 0.1

        # Decrease probability if passenger embarked from Southampton
        if row['embark_town_Southampton'] == 1.0:
            prob -= 0.1

        # Ensure probability is within [0, 1]
        prob = max(0, min(1, prob))

        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(prob)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code is a simple example and may not provide accurate predictions. For more accurate predictions, a machine learning model trained on the data should be used.
