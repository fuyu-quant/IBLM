Here is a simple example of a prediction function. This function uses a simple rule-based approach to predict the target. It checks if the passenger is female, if the passenger is in first class, and if the passenger is a child. If any of these conditions are met, it predicts a high probability of survival (0.9), otherwise it predicts a low probability of survival (0.1). This is a very basic approach and would likely not perform well in a real-world scenario, but it serves as an example of how you might start to approach this problem.

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0 or row['class_First'] == 1.0 or row['who_child'] == 1.0:
            y = 0.9
        else:
            y = 0.1
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

Please note that this is a very simple and naive approach to the problem. In a real-world scenario, you would likely want to use a machine learning model to make these predictions, as they can take into account complex interactions between variables and can learn from the data in a way that a simple rule-based approach cannot.
