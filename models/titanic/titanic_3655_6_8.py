Here is a simple example of a prediction function using a basic rule-based approach. This function assumes that the target is more likely to be 1 if the passenger is female, is in first class, and is an adult. This is a very simplistic approach and would likely not perform well in a real-world scenario, but it serves to illustrate the concept.

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0 and row['class_First'] == 1.0 and row['who_woman'] == 1.0:
            y = 0.9
        else:
            y = 0.1
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This function will return a high probability (0.9) if the passenger is female, in first class, and an adult, and a low probability (0.1) otherwise. Please note that this is a very basic example and a real-world prediction model would likely use a more sophisticated approach, such as a machine learning algorithm.
