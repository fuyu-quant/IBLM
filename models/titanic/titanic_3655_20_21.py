Here is a simple python code that predicts the probability of "target" being 1 based on the given data. This code uses a simple rule-based approach to predict the probability. The rules are based on the observation of the data. 

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Rule 1: If 'pclass' is 1 or 2, the probability of survival is high
        if row['pclass'] <= 2:
            y = 0.8
        else:
            y = 0.2

        # Rule 2: If 'sex_female' is 1, the probability of survival is high
        if row['sex_female'] == 1:
            y += 0.1
        else:
            y -= 0.1

        # Rule 3: If 'fare' is higher, the probability of survival is high
        if row['fare'] > 20:
            y += 0.05
        else:
            y -= 0.05

        # Rule 4: If 'age' is less, the probability of survival is high
        if row['age'] < 30:
            y += 0.05
        else:
            y -= 0.05

        # Ensure the probability is between 0 and 1
        y = max(min(y, 1), 0)

        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

Please note that this is a very simple rule-based approach and may not give very accurate results. For more accurate results, you should consider using machine learning algorithms.
