Here is a simple example of a prediction function that uses a basic rule-based approach. This function assumes that the target is more likely to be 1 if the passenger is female, is in first class, and embarked from Cherbourg. This is a very simplistic approach and would likely not perform well in a real-world scenario, but it serves to illustrate the basic structure of a prediction function.

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0 and row['class_First'] == 1.0 and row['embark_town_Cherbourg'] == 1.0:
            y = 0.9
        else:
            y = 0.1
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This function will return an array of predicted probabilities for each row in the input DataFrame. The probabilities are determined based on the conditions specified in the if statement. If a row meets all the conditions (i.e., the passenger is female, is in first class, and embarked from Cherbourg), the function predicts a high probability (0.9) that the target is 1. Otherwise, it predicts a low probability (0.1).
