Here is a simple example of a prediction function using a basic rule-based approach. This function assumes that the target is more likely to be 1 if the passenger is female, is in first class, and is not alone. This is a very simplistic approach and would not be suitable for a real-world application, but it serves to illustrate the basic structure of a prediction function.

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0 and row['pclass'] == 1.0 and row['alone_False'] == 1.0:
            y = 0.9
        else:
            y = 0.1
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This function will return a high probability for rows where the passenger is female, is in first class, and is not alone, and a low probability for all other rows. The specific probability values (0.9 and 0.1) are arbitrary and could be adjusted based on further analysis of the data.
