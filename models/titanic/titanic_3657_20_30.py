Here is a simple Python code that predicts the probability of "target" being 1 based on the given data. This code uses a simple rule-based approach to predict the probability. The rules are based on the observation of the data. 

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Rule 1: If 'sex_female' is 1, then the probability of 'target' being 1 is high.
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0:
            y = 0.8
        # Rule 2: If 'sex_male' is 1 and 'age' is less than 18, then the probability of 'target' being 1 is high.
        elif row['sex_male'] == 1.0 and row['age'] < 18.0:
            y = 0.7
        # Rule 3: If 'pclass' is 1 or 2, then the probability of 'target' being 1 is medium.
        elif row['pclass'] in [1.0, 2.0]:
            y = 0.5
        # Rule 4: If none of the above conditions are met, then the probability of 'target' being 1 is low.
        else:
            y = 0.2

        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

Please note that this is a very simple rule-based approach and may not provide the best accuracy. For better accuracy, you may need to use machine learning models.
