Here is a simple example of a prediction function that uses a basic rule-based approach. This function assumes that if the passenger is female, the target is more likely to be 1, and if the passenger is male, the target is more likely to be 0. This is a very simplistic approach and would not be very accurate in a real-world scenario, but it serves as an example of how you might start to approach this problem.

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # If the passenger is female, predict a high probability for target=1
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0:
            y = 0.9
        # If the passenger is male, predict a low probability for target=1
        elif row['sex_male'] == 1.0:
            y = 0.1
        # If the gender is unknown, predict a neutral probability
        else:
            y = 0.5
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This function could be improved by considering more features and creating more complex rules. For example, you might consider the passenger's age, fare, and class. You could also use statistical methods to determine the relationship between these features and the target variable, and use these relationships to make more accurate predictions.
