Here is a simple example of a prediction function that uses a basic rule-based approach. This function assumes that passengers who are female, young, and in first class have a higher probability of survival (target=1). This is based on the historical fact that during the Titanic disaster, the "women and children first" policy was applied for lifeboat seats, and first-class passengers had easier access to the lifeboats.

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        y = 0.0
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0:
            y += 0.3
        if row['age'] < 18.0:
            y += 0.3
        if row['pclass'] == 1.0:
            y += 0.3
        if y > 1.0:
            y = 1.0
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This function assigns a probability of survival based on three factors: being female, being a child, and being in first class. Each of these factors contributes 0.3 to the probability, so the maximum possible probability is 0.9. If none of these conditions are met, the function predicts a survival probability of 0.0.

Please note that this is a very simple and naive approach, and it's unlikely to provide accurate predictions for real-world data. For a more accurate model, you would need to use a machine learning algorithm that can learn from the data and make predictions based on complex patterns.
