Here is a simple example of a prediction function that uses a weighted sum of the features to predict the target. This function assumes that the features have been normalized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the weights for each feature
        weights = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3])
        
        # Calculate the weighted sum of the features
        y = np.dot(row[:-1], weights)
        
        # Normalize the prediction to be between 0 and 1
        y = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-y))
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This function calculates a weighted sum of the features for each row in the dataframe, then applies the logistic function to normalize the prediction to be between 0 and 1. The weights for each feature are defined in the `weights` array. These weights can be adjusted to improve the accuracy of the predictions.
