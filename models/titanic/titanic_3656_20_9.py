        # We are assuming that the target is more likely to be 1 if the passenger is female, is in first class, and is alone.
        # This is based on the historical fact that in the Titanic disaster, women, children, and first-class passengers were given priority for lifeboats.
        # We are also assuming that the target is more likely to be 0 if the passenger is male, is in third class, and is not alone.
        # This is based on the historical fact that men, third-class passengers, and families were less likely to survive.
        # The actual prediction is a weighted sum of these factors, with weights chosen to reflect their relative importance.
        # The weights are arbitrary and could be adjusted based on further analysis of the data.
