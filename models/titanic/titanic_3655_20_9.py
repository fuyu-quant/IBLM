Here is a simple Python code that predicts the probability of "target" being 1 based on the given data. This code uses a simple rule-based approach to predict the probability. It checks if the passenger is female, if the passenger is in first class, and if the passenger is a child. If all these conditions are met, it predicts a high probability of survival (0.9). If not, it predicts a low probability of survival (0.1). This is a very basic approach and may not provide accurate results for all cases.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        if row['sex_female'] == 1 and row['pclass'] == 1 and row['who_child'] == 1:
            y = 0.9
        else:
            y = 0.1
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

Please note that this is a very basic approach and may not provide accurate results for all cases. For a more accurate prediction, you would need to use a machine learning model trained on the given data.
