Here is a simple python code that uses a basic rule-based approach to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code assumes that the higher the fare and the lower the age, the higher the probability of survival. This is a very basic approach and may not provide accurate results. For more accurate results, a machine learning model should be used.

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Assuming that higher fare and lower age increases the probability of survival
        fare = row['fare']
        age = row['age']
        
        # Normalizing fare and age to be between 0 and 1
        fare = (fare - df['fare'].min()) / (df['fare'].max() - df['fare'].min())
        age = 1 - ((age - df['age'].min()) / (df['age'].max() - df['age'].min()))
        
        # Calculating the probability as the average of fare and age
        y = (fare + age) / 2
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first normalizes the fare and age to be between 0 and 1. Then it calculates the probability as the average of the normalized fare and age. The higher the fare and the lower the age, the higher the probability of survival. This is a very basic approach and may not provide accurate results. For more accurate results, a machine learning model should be used.
