Here is a simple example of a prediction function. This function uses a simple rule-based approach to predict the target. It checks if the passenger is a female and if the passenger is in the first class. If both conditions are true, it predicts a high probability of survival (0.9). Otherwise, it predicts a low probability of survival (0.1). This is a very simplistic approach and may not provide accurate results for all cases. 

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0 and row['class_First'] == 1.0:
            y = 0.9
        else:
            y = 0.1
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

Please note that this is a very basic example and does not take into account many other factors that could influence the survival of a passenger. For a more accurate prediction, you would need to use a machine learning model trained on a large dataset.
