Here is a simple example of a prediction function. This function uses a simple rule-based approach to predict the target. It assumes that if the passenger is female, young, and in the first class, then the target is likely to be 1 (survived). Otherwise, the target is likely to be 0 (did not survive). This is a very simplistic approach and may not provide accurate results. For more accurate results, a machine learning model should be trained on the data.

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0 and row['age'] < 18.0 and row['pclass'] == 1.0:
            y = 1.0
        else:
            y = 0.0
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

Please note that this is a very basic example and does not take into account many factors that could influence the survival of a passenger on the Titanic. For a more accurate prediction, a machine learning model should be trained on the data.
