Here is a simple example of a prediction function that uses a basic rule-based approach. This function assumes that passengers who are female, young, and in first class have a higher probability of survival. This is based on historical data from the Titanic disaster, where women, children, and first-class passengers were given priority for lifeboat seats.

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        y = 0.0
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0:
            y += 0.3
        if row['age'] <= 18.0:
            y += 0.3
        if row['pclass'] == 1.0:
            y += 0.3
        if y > 1.0:
            y = 1.0
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This function assigns a probability of survival based on three factors: whether the passenger is female, whether the passenger is a child (18 years old or younger), and whether the passenger is in first class. Each of these factors contributes 0.3 to the probability of survival, up to a maximum of 1.0.

Please note that this is a very simplistic model and is unlikely to provide accurate predictions for real-world data. For a more accurate model, you would likely need to use a machine learning algorithm trained on a large dataset.
