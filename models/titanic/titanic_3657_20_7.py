        # Here we are using a simple rule-based approach to predict the target.
        # The rules are based on the observations from the given data.
        # For example, if 'sex_female' is 1, 'alone_True' is 1, and 'fare' is high, the probability of survival is high.
        # Similarly, if 'sex_male' is 1, 'alone_True' is 1, and 'fare' is low, the probability of survival is low.
        # These rules are not perfect and may not work well on unseen data.
        # For a more accurate prediction, a machine learning model should be trained on the data.
