Here is a simple example of a prediction function. This function calculates the mean of each column for each target class (0 and 1) and then for a given row, it calculates the Euclidean distance to the mean of each class. The class with the smallest distance is predicted as the target class. The probability is then calculated as the inverse of the distance.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy.spatial import distance

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    
    # Calculate the mean of each column for each target class
    mean_class_0 = df[df['target'] == 0].mean()
    mean_class_1 = df[df['target'] == 1].mean()
    
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Calculate the Euclidean distance to the mean of each class
        dist_0 = distance.euclidean(row[:-1], mean_class_0[:-1])
        dist_1 = distance.euclidean(row[:-1], mean_class_1[:-1])
        
        # The class with the smallest distance is predicted as the target class
        if dist_0 < dist_1:
            y = 1 / dist_0
        else:
            y = 1 / dist_1
        
        output.append(y)
    
    return np.array(output)
```

Please note that this is a very simple and naive approach and it may not work well for complex datasets. For a more accurate prediction, you should consider using a machine learning model.
