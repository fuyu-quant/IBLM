Here is a simple example of a prediction function. This function uses a simple rule-based approach to predict the target. It assumes that if the passenger is female, the target is more likely to be 1, and if the passenger is male, the target is more likely to be 0. This is a very simplistic approach and would not be very accurate in a real-world scenario, but it serves as an example of how you might structure your prediction function.

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0:
            y = 0.75
        else:
            y = 0.25
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

In this function, we iterate over each row in the dataframe. If the 'sex_female' column is 1.0, we predict a high probability (0.75) for the target. If 'sex_female' is not 1.0 (which means the passenger is male), we predict a low probability (0.25) for the target. The predicted probabilities are stored in the 'output' list, which is then converted to a numpy array before being returned by the function.

Please note that this is a very basic example and does not take into account many factors that could influence the target. A more sophisticated approach would likely use a machine learning model trained on the data to make predictions.
