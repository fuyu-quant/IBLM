Here is a simple example of a prediction function. This function uses a simple rule-based approach to predict the target. It checks if the passenger is a female and if the passenger class is not 3rd class. If both conditions are met, it predicts a high probability of survival (0.9), otherwise it predicts a low probability of survival (0.1). This is a very basic approach and may not provide accurate results. For more accurate results, a machine learning model should be trained on the data.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0 and row['class_Third'] != 1.0:
            y = 0.9
        else:
            y = 0.1
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

Please note that this function assumes that the input `x` is a pandas DataFrame with the same structure as the provided data. The function iterates over each row in the DataFrame, checks the conditions, and appends the prediction to the output list. The output is then converted to a numpy array before being returned.
