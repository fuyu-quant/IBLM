Here is a simple python code that uses a basic rule-based approach to predict the probability of the target being 1. This code assumes that the target is more likely to be 1 if the passenger is female, is in the first class, and embarked from Cherbourg. This is a very basic approach and may not provide accurate results for all cases.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        y = 0.0
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0:
            y += 0.3
        if row['class_First'] == 1.0:
            y += 0.3
        if row['embark_town_Cherbourg'] == 1.0:
            y += 0.3
        if y > 1.0:
            y = 1.0
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code will return a probability value between 0 and 1 for each row in the input dataframe. The probability is calculated based on the values in the 'sex_female', 'class_First', and 'embark_town_Cherbourg' columns. If all three conditions are met, the probability will be 1. If none of the conditions are met, the probability will be 0. If only one or two conditions are met, the probability will be 0.3 or 0.6, respectively.
