Here is a simple example of a prediction function that uses a basic rule-based approach. This function assumes that passengers who are female, young, and in first class have a higher probability of survival. This is based on historical data from the Titanic disaster, where women, children, and first-class passengers were given priority for lifeboat seats.

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        y = 0.0
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0:
            y += 0.3
        if row['age'] <= 18.0:
            y += 0.3
        if row['pclass'] == 1.0:
            y += 0.3
        if y > 1.0:
            y = 1.0
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This function assigns a base probability of survival of 0.0 to each passenger. It then increases this probability by 0.3 if the passenger is female, by 0.3 if the passenger is 18 years old or younger, and by 0.3 if the passenger is in first class. The maximum probability of survival is capped at 1.0.

Please note that this is a very simplistic model and is unlikely to provide accurate predictions for all cases. For a more accurate model, you would likely need to use a machine learning algorithm trained on a large dataset.
