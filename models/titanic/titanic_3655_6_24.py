Here is a simple example of a prediction function. This function calculates the mean of each column for each target class (0 and 1) and then for each row in the input data, it calculates the Euclidean distance to the mean of each class. The function then returns the probability of the row belonging to class 1 by applying the softmax function to the distances.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy.spatial import distance

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    
    # Calculate the mean of each column for each target class
    class_0_mean = df[df['target'] == 0].mean()
    class_1_mean = df[df['target'] == 1].mean()
    
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Calculate the Euclidean distance to the mean of each class
        dist_0 = distance.euclidean(row, class_0_mean)
        dist_1 = distance.euclidean(row, class_1_mean)
        
        # Calculate the probability of the row belonging to class 1
        prob_1 = np.exp(-dist_1) / (np.exp(-dist_0) + np.exp(-dist_1))
        
        output.append(prob_1)
    
    return np.array(output)
```

Please note that this is a very simple and naive approach to prediction and it assumes that the data is normally distributed which might not be the case. For a more accurate prediction, you should use a machine learning model that is trained on your data.
