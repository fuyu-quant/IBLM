Here is a simple example of a prediction function. This function uses a simple rule-based approach to predict the target. The rules are based on the mean values of the features for each target class. If the feature values of a data point are closer to the mean values of the features for target 1, the function predicts a high probability for target 1. If the feature values are closer to the mean values for target 0, the function predicts a low probability for target 1.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    
    # Calculate the mean values of the features for each target class
    mean_values_target_0 = df[df['target'] == 0].mean()
    mean_values_target_1 = df[df['target'] == 1].mean()
    
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Calculate the Euclidean distance between the feature values of the data point and the mean values of the features for each target class
        distance_to_target_0 = np.sqrt(np.sum((row - mean_values_target_0)**2))
        distance_to_target_1 = np.sqrt(np.sum((row - mean_values_target_1)**2))
        
        # If the distance to target 1 is smaller, predict a high probability for target 1
        if distance_to_target_1 < distance_to_target_0:
            y = 0.9
        # If the distance to target 0 is smaller, predict a low probability for target 1
        else:
            y = 0.1
        
        output.append(y)
    
    return np.array(output)
```

Please note that this is a very simple and naive approach to prediction. In a real-world scenario, you would likely use a machine learning model to make predictions. This function also assumes that all features are equally important, which might not be the case.
