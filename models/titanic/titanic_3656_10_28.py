        # This is based on the historical fact that women, children, and first-class passengers were given priority during the evacuation of the Titanic.
        # We also consider the age of the passenger, assuming that younger passengers are more likely to survive.
        # The fare paid by the passenger is also considered, assuming that passengers who paid more are more likely to survive.
        # This is a very simplistic approach and may not give accurate results for all cases.
