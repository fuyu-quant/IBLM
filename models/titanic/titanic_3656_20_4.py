        # The rules are based on the observations from the given data.
        # For example, if 'sex_female' is 1, 'alone_True' is 1 and 'fare' is greater than 50, 
        # the probability of survival (target=1) is high.
        # Similarly, if 'sex_male' is 1, 'alone_True' is 1 and 'fare' is less than 10, 
        # the probability of survival (target=1) is low.
        # These rules are not perfect and may not generalize well to unseen data.
        # For a more robust solution, a machine learning model should be trained on the data.
