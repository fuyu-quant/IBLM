Here is a simple example of a prediction function that uses a basic rule-based approach. This function assumes that the target is more likely to be 1 if the passenger is female, is in first class, and embarked from Cherbourg. This is a very simplistic approach and would likely not perform well in a real-world scenario, but it serves as an example of how you might begin to approach this problem without using a machine learning model.

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        p = 0.0
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0:
            p += 0.3
        if row['pclass'] == 1.0:
            p += 0.3
        if row['embarked_C'] == 1.0:
            p += 0.3
        if p > 1.0:
            p = 1.0
        y = p
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This function will return a probability value for each row in the input DataFrame. The probability is calculated as the sum of the weights assigned to each of the three conditions checked in the function. If the sum of the weights exceeds 1.0, it is capped at 1.0. The weights (0.3 in this case) are arbitrary and should be adjusted based on the actual influence of each condition on the target variable.
