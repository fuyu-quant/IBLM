Here is a simple example of a prediction function. This function uses a simple rule-based approach to predict the target. It checks if the passenger is a female, if she is alone, and if she is in the first class. If all these conditions are met, it predicts a high probability of survival (target=1), otherwise it predicts a low probability of survival (target=0). 

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0 and row['alone_True'] == 1.0 and row['class_First'] == 1.0:
            y = 1.0
        else:
            y = 0.0
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

Please note that this is a very simple and naive approach and it's not expected to perform well on a real-world dataset. For a more accurate prediction, you would typically use a machine learning model trained on the dataset.
