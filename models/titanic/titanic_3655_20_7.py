Here is a simple example of a prediction function that uses a rule-based approach. This function assumes that the target is more likely to be 1 if the passenger is female, is in first class, and embarked from Cherbourg. This is a very simplistic approach and would likely not perform well in practice, but it serves as an example of how you might begin to approach this problem without using a machine learning model.

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0 and row['class_First'] == 1.0 and row['embark_town_Cherbourg'] == 1.0:
            y = 1.0
        else:
            y = 0.0
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This function will return an array of 1s and 0s, where a 1 indicates a high probability of the target being 1 and a 0 indicates a low probability. The function iterates over each row in the input DataFrame, checks the values of the 'sex_female', 'class_First', and 'embark_town_Cherbourg' columns, and assigns a high probability if all of these conditions are met. Otherwise, it assigns a low probability.
