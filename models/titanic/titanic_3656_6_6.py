Here is a simple python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code assumes that the input data is a pandas DataFrame.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    
    # Define the logistic regression model
    model = LogisticRegression()
    
    # Split the data into features and target
    features = df.drop('target', axis=1)
    target = df['target']
    
    # Fit the model to the data
    model.fit(features, target)
    
    # Predict the probabilities for each row in the data
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Reshape the row to 2D array as the model expects this shape
        row = row.drop('target').values.reshape(1, -1)
        
        # Predict the probability for the row
        prob = model.predict_proba(row)
        
        # The second element of the first (and only) item in the output
        # is the probability that the target is 1
        y = prob[0][1]
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
        
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first trains a logistic regression model on the entire dataset. Then, for each row in the dataset, it predicts the probability that the target is 1. The predicted probabilities are returned as a numpy array.
