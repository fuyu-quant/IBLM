Here is a simple example of a prediction function. This function uses a simple rule-based approach to predict the target. It assumes that if the passenger is female, the target is more likely to be 1, and if the passenger is male, the target is more likely to be 0. This is a very simplistic approach and would not be very accurate in a real-world scenario, but it serves as an example of how you might structure your prediction function.

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # If the passenger is female, predict a high probability for target 1
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0:
            y = 0.9
        # If the passenger is male, predict a low probability for target 1
        elif row['sex_male'] == 1.0:
            y = 0.1
        # If the gender is unknown, predict a neutral probability
        else:
            y = 0.5
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

Please note that this is a very basic example and does not take into account most of the features in the dataset. A more sophisticated approach would be to use a machine learning model to make the predictions, but the task specifies not to use an existing machine learning model.
