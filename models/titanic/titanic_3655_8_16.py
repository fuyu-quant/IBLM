Here is a simple example of a prediction function that uses a basic rule-based approach. This function assumes that the target is more likely to be 1 if the passenger is female, is in first class, and is not alone. This is a very simplistic approach and would likely not perform well in a real-world scenario, but it serves to illustrate the basic structure of a prediction function.

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0 and row['pclass'] == 1.0 and row['alone_False'] == 1.0:
            y = 1.0
        else:
            y = 0.0
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This function could be improved by incorporating more features into the prediction rule, or by using a more sophisticated prediction algorithm. However, without more information about the relationship between the features and the target, it's difficult to make specific recommendations.
