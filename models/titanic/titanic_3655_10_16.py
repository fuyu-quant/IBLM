Here is a simple Python code that predicts the probability of "target" being 1 based on the given data. This code uses a simple rule-based approach to predict the probability. It checks if the passenger is female, if the passenger is in first class, and if the passenger is a child. If all these conditions are met, it predicts a high probability of survival (0.9). If only two conditions are met, it predicts a medium-high probability (0.7). If only one condition is met, it predicts a medium-low probability (0.5). If none of the conditions are met, it predicts a low probability of survival (0.1).

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        if row['sex_female'] == 1 and row['class_First'] == 1 and row['who_child'] == 1:
            y = 0.9
        elif (row['sex_female'] == 1 and row['class_First'] == 1) or (row['sex_female'] == 1 and row['who_child'] == 1) or (row['class_First'] == 1 and row['who_child'] == 1):
            y = 0.7
        elif row['sex_female'] == 1 or row['class_First'] == 1 or row['who_child'] == 1:
            y = 0.5
        else:
            y = 0.1
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

Please note that this is a very simple rule-based approach and may not provide the most accurate predictions. For more accurate predictions, you may want to consider using a machine learning model.
