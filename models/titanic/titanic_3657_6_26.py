Here is a simple example of a prediction function. This function calculates the mean of each column for each target class (0 and 1) and then for a given row, it calculates the Euclidean distance to the mean of each class. The class with the smallest distance is predicted as the target class. The function then returns the inverse of this distance as a probability. This is a very simple and naive approach and is not expected to perform well on complex datasets.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy.spatial import distance

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    
    # Calculate the mean of each column for each target class
    means = df.groupby('target').mean()
    
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Calculate the Euclidean distance to the mean of each class
        dist_0 = distance.euclidean(row[:-1], means.loc[0])
        dist_1 = distance.euclidean(row[:-1], means.loc[1])
        
        # Predict the class with the smallest distance
        if dist_0 < dist_1:
            y = 1 / dist_0
        else:
            y = 1 / dist_1
        
        output.append(y)
    
    return np.array(output)
```

Please note that this function assumes that the target column is the last column in the dataframe. Also, this function does not handle missing values or categorical variables. It is also sensitive to the scale of the variables, so it might be necessary to normalize the data before using this function.
