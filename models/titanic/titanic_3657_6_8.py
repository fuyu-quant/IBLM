Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.0
        for i in range(len(row)-1):
            z += row[i] * 0.01  # Assume all weights are 0.01 for simplicity

        # Apply the sigmoid function to get the probability
        y = sigmoid(z)

        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a helper function `sigmoid(x)` that implements the sigmoid function, which is used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1]. This function is then used in the `predict(x)` function to compute the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1.

In the `predict(x)` function, we first make a copy of the input DataFrame `x` to avoid modifying the original data. We then iterate over each row in the DataFrame, and for each row, we compute the dot product of the row and a weight vector (in this case, we simply assume all weights are 0.01 for simplicity), and apply the sigmoid function to this dot product to get the probability that the "target" is 1. This probability is then appended to the `output` list, which is finally converted to a NumPy array and returned.

Please note that this is a very basic and naive implementation of logistic regression, and in a real-world scenario, you would typically use a more sophisticated machine learning model and train it on your data to get the optimal weights.
