Here is a simple example of a prediction function that uses a basic rule-based approach. This function assumes that the target is more likely to be 1 if the passenger is female, is in first class, and is alone. This is based on the historical fact that women, children, and those in first class were given priority during the evacuation of the Titanic.

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        y = 0.0
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0:
            y += 0.3
        if row['pclass'] == 1.0:
            y += 0.3
        if row['alone_True'] == 1.0:
            y += 0.4
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This function will return a probability value between 0 and 1 for each row in the input DataFrame. The higher the value, the more likely the target is to be 1 according to the rules defined in the function.

Please note that this is a very simple and naive approach and is unlikely to provide accurate predictions for real-world data. For a more accurate model, you would typically use a machine learning algorithm trained on a large dataset.
