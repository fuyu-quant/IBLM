Here is a simple example of a prediction function that uses a basic rule-based approach. This function assumes that passengers who are female, in first class, and embarked from Cherbourg have a higher probability of survival (target=1), while others have a lower probability. This is a very simplistic approach and may not provide accurate results, but it serves as a starting point.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0 and row['pclass'] == 1.0 and row['embarked_C'] == 1.0:
            y = 0.9  # High probability of survival
        else:
            y = 0.1  # Low probability of survival
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This function can be used as follows:

```python
# Create a DataFrame from the given data
data = [
    [3.0,28.0,1.0,0.0,16.1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1],
    [2.0,29.0,1.0,0.0,27.7208,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0]
]
columns = ['pclass', 'age', 'sibsp', 'parch', 'fare', 'sex_female', 'sex_male', 'embarked_C', 'embarked_Q', 'embarked_S', 'alive_no', 'alive_yes', 'alone_False', 'alone_True', 'adult_male_False', 'adult_male_True', 'who_child', 'who_man', 'who_woman', 'class_First', 'class_Second', 'class_Third', 'deck_A', 'deck_B', 'deck_C', 'deck_D', 'deck_E', 'deck_F', 'deck_G', 'embark_town_Cherbourg', 'embark_town_Queenstown', 'embark_town_Southampton', 'target']
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=columns)

# Use the prediction function
predictions = predict(df)
print(predictions)
```

This will output a numpy array with the predicted probabilities.
