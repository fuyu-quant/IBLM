Here is a simple example of a prediction function that uses a basic rule-based approach. This function assumes that passengers who are female, in first class, and embarked from Cherbourg have a high probability of survival, while all others have a low probability of survival. This is a very simplistic approach and would likely not perform well in practice, but it serves as an example of how you might structure your prediction function.

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        if row['sex_female'] == 1 and row['class_First'] == 1 and row['embark_town_Cherbourg'] == 1:
            y = 0.9
        else:
            y = 0.1
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This function could be improved by incorporating more features and using more complex logic to make predictions. For example, you could use the age and fare features to make more nuanced predictions. You could also use machine learning techniques to train a model on the data and use that model to make predictions. However, the prompt specifically asked for a function that does not use a machine learning model.
