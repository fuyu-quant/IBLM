Here is a simple Python code that predicts the probability of "target" being 1 based on the given data. This code uses a simple rule-based approach where it checks certain conditions in the data to predict the probability. 

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Initialize probability to 0.5
        prob = 0.5

        # If the passenger is female, increase the probability
        if row['sex_female'] == 1:
            prob += 0.2

        # If the passenger is in first class, increase the probability
        if row['pclass'] == 1:
            prob += 0.1

        # If the passenger is a child, increase the probability
        if row['who_child'] == 1:
            prob += 0.1

        # If the passenger embarked from Cherbourg, increase the probability
        if row['embark_town_Cherbourg'] == 1:
            prob += 0.05

        # If the passenger is alone, decrease the probability
        if row['alone_True'] == 1:
            prob -= 0.05

        # Ensure probability is within [0, 1]
        prob = min(max(prob, 0), 1)

        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(prob)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code is a simple rule-based model and does not use any machine learning techniques. The rules are based on the assumption that certain factors (like being female, being in first class, being a child, and embarking from Cherbourg) increase the chance of survival, while other factors (like being alone) decrease the chance of survival. The weights for each factor are arbitrary and can be adjusted for better accuracy.
