Here is a simple example of a prediction function that uses a basic rule-based approach. This function assumes that the target is more likely to be 1 if the passenger is female, is in first class, and is not alone. This is a very simplistic approach and would likely not perform well in a real-world scenario, but it serves to illustrate the concept.

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0 and row['class_First'] == 1.0 and row['alone_False'] == 1.0:
            y = 1.0
        else:
            y = 0.0
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This function would be used like this:

```python
predictions = predict(df)
```

Where `df` is a pandas DataFrame containing the input data. The function returns a numpy array of predictions, with 1.0 indicating a high probability of the target being 1, and 0.0 indicating a low probability.
