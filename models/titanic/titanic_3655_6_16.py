Here is a simple example of a prediction function that uses a basic rule-based approach. This function assumes that if the passenger is female, the probability of survival is high (0.75), and if the passenger is male, the probability of survival is low (0.25). This is a very simplistic approach and does not take into account all the other features in the dataset.

```python
import numpy as np

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        if row['sex_female'] == 1.0:
            y = 0.75
        else:
            y = 0.25
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

Please note that this is a very basic example and does not take into account all the other features in the dataset. For a more accurate prediction, you would need to use a machine learning model that can learn from all the features in the dataset.
