        # Here we are using a simple rule-based approach to predict the target.
        # We assume that the target is more likely to be 1 if the passenger is female, embarked from Cherbourg, travelling in first class, and is alone.
        # This is based on the historical data from the Titanic disaster, where women, children, and first-class passengers were more likely to survive.
        # We also consider the age of the passenger, with younger passengers being more likely to survive.
        # The fare paid by the passenger is also considered, with higher fares indicating a higher likelihood of survival.
        # This is a very simplistic approach and would likely be improved with a more sophisticated machine learning model.
