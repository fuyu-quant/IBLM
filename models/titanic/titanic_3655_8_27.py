Here is a simple Python code that uses a basic logistic regression model to predict the probability that the "target" of the unknown data is 1. This code does not use any existing machine learning model, but rather implements the logistic regression model from scratch.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def sigmoid(z):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z))

def predict(x):
    df = x.copy()
    output = []
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        # Do not change the code before this point.
        # Please describe the process required to make the prediction below.
        
        # Define the logistic regression model
        z = 0.0
        for i in range(len(row)-1):
            z += row[i] * np.random.uniform(-1, 1)
        
        # Apply the sigmoid function to get the probability
        y = sigmoid(z)
        
        # Do not change the code after this point.
        output.append(y)
    return np.array(output)
```

This code first defines a sigmoid function, which is used in logistic regression to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1], which can be interpreted as probabilities. Then, in the predict function, it iterates over each row of the input DataFrame, applies the logistic regression model to the features of the row (excluding the last column, which is the target), and appends the resulting probability to the output list. The logistic regression model is defined as a linear combination of the features, where the coefficients are random numbers between -1 and 1. This is a very basic and naive implementation of logistic regression, and in a real-world scenario, the coefficients should be learned from the data using a learning algorithm.
